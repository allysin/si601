UMSI601 Project for Data Manipulation Winter 2014

Class project to take two different data sets and manipulate them together in some way. I pulled articles that contained the word
"Bitcoin" from The Guardian using their API and used second sentiment analysis API to encode the articles as either positive or
negative. I then compared this reporting with the value of Bitcoin to see if there was any relationship between reporting on
Bitcoin in The Guardian and it's value.
