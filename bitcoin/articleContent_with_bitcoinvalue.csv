2014-02-18,I advised House of Cards on its season two plot | Gregg Housh,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/18/house-of-cards-season-two-hacker-gregg-housh,"Photograph: Capital EconomicsMark Williams of Capital Economics argues that the surprise weakness of the Chinese renminbi in recent days shows that its central bank is plotting something:The Peopleâ€™s Bank of China (PBC) has engineered an abrupt fall in the renminbi over the past week or so (see chart above).Its immediate aim appears to be to shift market expectations of continued, steady appreciation against the dollar. But the unusual (for the renminbi) scale of the decline may also signal a broader shift in policy stance.Over the past few years, with the renminbi widely seen as undervalued, Chinaâ€™s primary line of defence against speculative inflows has been its capital controls. Recently though, the PBC has come to the view that the renminbi is close to its â€œfairâ€ù market value. It believes in turn that a key constraint on opening up the capital account has been lifted. The main remaining barrier, in the PBCâ€™s eyes, is the engrained (but, it feels, unjustified) market expectation that the renminbi will appreciate which fuels speculative inflows. A period of greater market volatility lies ahead as the PBC attempts to reset that view.Whether this works will depend ultimately on whether speculative flows are the main remaining source of upward pressure on the renminbi. We donâ€™t think they are. Chinaâ€™s current account surplus remains large and looks likely to grow. The healthy returns on funds invested in China are still attracting more capital to the country than is going overseas. As a result, we continue to expect further exchange rate appreciation this year along with substantial foreign exchange accumulation. But investors should be prepared for greater volatility along the way.However, Alphavilleâ€™s Izabella Kaminska has another theory: that Chinese firms had, until recently, been trying to make a quick profit by borrowing US dollars, converting it into yuan, buying domestic debt, and planning to cash in by reversing the trade once the yuan had strengthened, as seemed inevitable.That trade could now be unravelling, she suggests, if there simply arenâ€™t enough US dollars available (as capital flows back to the US).More here: The curious incident of the PBOC in the USDCNY market",280.0,370.0,248.14826000000002,293.8,48454.96,13829969.71,285.42
2014-02-18,Power to the people,http://www.theguardian.com/advertising/digital-media-trends-power-people,"The Open Europe thinktank has published a research note on todayâ€™s EC winter forecasts.Hereâ€™s some highlights:Inflation forecast cutA metric which everyone is watching at the moment is inflation. As we have discussed before, March has been pegged as a key meeting for the ECB and is expected to be a defining choice over whether the bank takes more action to tackle inflation. The EC has cut its forecast for inflation from 1.5% to 1.1% for this year while last yearâ€™s has been revised to 1.3% from 1.5%. Despite the language being quite strong on inflation remaining low and subdued, these forecasts arenâ€™t far from the ECBâ€™s own and are unlikely to push them one way or another when it comes to taking further action. The graph also highlights that the view of core inflation (without energy or food prices) been on a slow decline for some time but is expected to melt upwards over the coming years. Again this fits with current ECB thinking rather than bucking against it. Photograph: ECSpain and Italy â€“ diverging forecasts, but plenty of common problemsOne of the more surprising points is that Spain has got the most substantial upgrade of all the big eurozone countries â€“ with its 2014 growth forecast raised from +0.5% to +1%. At the same time Italy is the only big eurozone country whose growth forecast for this year has been revised downwards â€“ from +0.7% to +0.6%. Similarly, on the unemployment side (while Spain remains in a much worse position) the forecast has improved somewhat for Spain and worsened for Italy. In any case, both continue to struggle with their large debt loads (more below), although new Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi might take the less than optimistic forecast as an important reminder of the reforms he needs to pursue, not unlike the ones Spain has undertakenâ€_Debt remains a problem in the eurozoneBy 2015, seven eurozone countries are forecast to have public debt levels above 100% of GDP â€“ Belgium, Ireland, Cyprus, Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. As the report warns, this debt overhang could become a drag on medium term growth, particularly when combined with other factors such as the knock on effects of years of depressed investment, high unemployment and falling productivity.The full note is here:  The European Commissionâ€™s new economic forecasts: Fragile recovery continues, but problems remain",280.0,370.0,248.14826000000002,293.8,48454.96,13829969.71,285.42
2014-02-18,What is Doge?,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/18/doge-such-questions-very-answered,"The FTSE 100 is still in the red as trading comes towards a close, down 35 points or 0.5% at 6811.Mining stocks continue to drag the market down, as investors fear a sharp slowdown in China as banking lending is tightened. Fresnillo is down 3.2%, followed by Rio Tinto (-2.8%), Anglo American (-2.3%) and Antofagasta (-2.2%).Michael Hewson of CMC Markets blames the selloff on the surprise drop in the yuan today, which many analysts believe means the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China is softening up the markets for new economic reforms next week.He writes:Nothing sums up the fickle nature of equity markets more than todayâ€™s market reaction to the very same events that we knew about yesterday morning, and the concerns being expressed about Chinese bank lending and possible future steps that Chinese authorities might take in seeking to take some of the heat out of the property market. The catalyst on this occasion appears to have been further sharp falls in the Chinese currency while Chinese stock markets dropped back near to multi month lows.Wall Street, though, is pretty flat. Hewson again:While European markets appear to have taken fright from the dive in Chinese markets it would appear that US markets are much less concerned opening slightly lower after the record highs posted on the S&P500 yesterday.Stocks in focus include JP Morgan who announced that they would be cutting thousands of more jobs in addition to the 13,000 already announced due to plunging demand for home loans, which raises concerns about the longer term health of the US housing market.Also in focus DIY retailer Home Depot opened higher after their latest earnings report beat market expectations, coming in at $0.73c a share, though we could well see any gains tempered by the fact that the outlook for 2014 was adjusted lower.",280.0,370.0,248.14826000000002,293.8,48454.96,13829969.71,285.42

Rebalancing of the European economy has been progressing and external competitiveness is improving, particularly in the most vulnerable countries. The worst of the crisis may now be behind us, but this is not an invitation to be complacent, as the recovery is still modest. To make the recovery stronger and create more jobs, we need to stay the course of economic reform.And todayâ€™s winter forecasts (see here onwards) also shows that government deficits are expected to keep falling -- to 2.7% of GDP in the EU and 2.6% in the euro area.That will push total debt-to-GDP ratios to almost 90% in the EU and 96% in the euro area.",582.54,609.4949,550.0,578.78,16337.05,9326077.01,570.85

Today there is alarm that its currency, the yuan, has weakened; good for exporters, but possibly a sign of concern that the domestic economy is weakening.Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, said the rout on the Shanghai stock market was weighing on UK shares:After yesterdayâ€™s rampant close, UK markets have started the day on the back foot after Chinese stocks slumped overnight, with concerns over a cooling property market and lending curbs hampering consumer growth spilling over to the second trading day of the week.As with any Chinese story the miners lead declines, sending the FTSEâ€™s basic materials sector over 2% lower and leaving the benchmark lagging behind its European peers.  Joao Monteiro, analyst at Monex Capital Markets, said traders fear further steep losses in China:Shanghai recorded its worst day in seven months with the composite index dropping by over 2% as fears are heightened that a collapse in the property bubble is getting ever closer. Itâ€™s been property development companies that have borne the brunt of the sell-off, but the real fear is that any slowdown in the property market will be felt across the board with consumption of everything from small electronics to cars likely to suffer.This chart from the Wall Street Journal shows how the Chinese yuan, usually tightly controlled,  has weakened in recent days.

Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business.Many world stock markets remain pretty buoyant today, with many close to their highest levels in years, but fears over the state of the Chinese banking sector and the strength of the global economy are lingering.Last night, the US S&P 500 ended a whisker away from its record closing high, and Australiaâ€™s ASX 200 index hit its highest level in five and a half-years overnight -- driven by banks and insurers -- before dropping back.In Europe, the London FTSE 100 has fallen in opening trading after hitting a 14-year closing high last night. The blue-chip index of leading shares is down 29 point at 6836, a drop of 0.4%, pushed down by mining stocks.This comes as City traders chatter that the Footsie could soon crash over the 7,000 point mark for the first time ever.The news overnight that Italian PM Mattei Renzi won his confidence vote in the Italian Senate, cementing his authority as leader, has helped boost optimism. Chris Weston of IG reckons that bullish traders have taken their cue from decent financial results, rather than fretting about what the world central banks will do: Global earnings have been good from all parts and this has been the key input, which of course should always be the case, as over the longer-term share prices should generally follow earnings and cash flows.

2014-01-10,Today's media stories from the papers,http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/10/media-briefing-friday-10-january,"Bitcoin is here to stay, despite a little hiccup in Japan. The digital currency, seen by its promoters as a super-efficient way to pay online, has suffered a setback with the Tokyo-based MtGox business, that once boasted it was the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, evaporating, at least for now. This would mean little if it could explain where bitcoins worth several million pounds held in its databanks have gone. The owners say they have yet to get an explanation.There is a strong rumour, based on a supposedly leaked report from the exchange, that theft accounts for around 744,000 missing bitcoins, or 6% of the entire world stock. With a bitcoin valued at more than $500 before the story broke, the theft could leave users more than $370m out of pocket.Such a huge loss would engulf most businesses in a welter of lawsuits. The digital currency was already battered by criticism pointing out its popularity with criminal gangs seeking to evade regulators or anti-fraud police. Critics also highlighted its lack of government support and the volatile price, which soared above $1,200 before Christmas before falling back below $420 on Tuesday.Techies claim they are the equivalent of Klondyke miners with a pick and shovel chipping away at rocks dotted with ore. In a sense that is how they come by their booty, except that the chipping is done by an algorithm and the whole exercise performed on a PC, perhaps from the safety of their bedroom. In a masterstroke, the currency's creator set a limit on the amount that could be generated, making everyone think that its limited supply would mean the price can only go up.That part of the plan at least seems to be unravelling. But even if the MtGox debacle hurts bitcoin beyond repair, it will be back in another guise â€“ if only because digital currencies give clever people who lack the interpersonal skills to make it in business a chance to make a quick million bucks.Until the skills and cunning of bitcoiners can be redirected into something more useful, they will keep at it.",935.0,964.99,906.0,957.89998,6000.45,5605099.47,934.11

We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.â€ùUntil the statement was posted, the site was just a blank white page from Monday night until Tuesday morning, while the companyâ€™s Twitter account was wiped blank on Monday. On Sunday, its chief executive Mark Karpeles resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, the charity that promotes the use of the cryptocurrency.MtGoxâ€™s apparent closure or hiatus also follows the leak of what is alleged to be a â€œcrisis strategy documentâ€ù from the company, which says that almost 750,000 bitcoins (currently worth more than Â£200m) are â€œmissingâ€ù due to theft which went unnoticed for several years.In a joint letter, the CEOs of a number of other bitcoin exchanges said that MtGox had confirmed its â€œissuesâ€ù in private discussions. The founders of Coinbase, and the CEOs of Kraken, BitStamp, Circle, BTC China & Blockchain.info, released the statement late Monday night.â€œAs with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today,â€ù it reads in part. â€œWe are confident, however, that strong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the internet age.â€ùThe claimed MtGox strategy document claims that the 750,000 bitcoin loss is as a result of the same â€œtransaction malleabilityâ€ù issue which caused it to halt bitcoin withdrawals in early February; but says that the actual losses happened closer to when the problem, which is inherent to bitcoin, was discovered in 2011.The document suggests that a temporary closure, and rebrand to â€œGox.comâ€ù, may be enough to clean the companyâ€™s image. As for making up the missing millions, it proposes asking â€œbitcoin big players and the core communityâ€ù to donate money. The rationale is that the total collapse of MtGox would be so bad for the digital currency that everyone who is invested in bitcoin will have a motivation to keep it alive.Before the company issued the statement, the source code of the blank MtGox page contained an HTML comment reading â€œ<!-- put announce for mtgox acq here -->â€ù, suggesting that it is soon to announce an acquisition.On the Reddit bitcoin subforum, users traded stories about how much they lost in the closure. One who claimed to have lost 4,750 bitcoins (Â£1.3m) said â€œI donâ€™t know how dying feels, but Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s how I feel now.â€ù Another lost 1998 bitcoin but says â€œDespite all this, Iâ€™m still a believer in bitcoin (just not so much other people).â€ùBitcoin prices were down across the board, with the Winkdex price index showing a 22% drop in the price of one bitcoin in the past 24 hours over five of the largest exchanges from $581 to $437.MtGox did not respond to requests for comment. The Japan-based company, which was originally known as the Magic the Gathering Online Exchange, began as a site for selling cards from the popular Magic trading card game. It rapidly pivoted into selling bitcoin in 2010, and was sold to Mark Karpeles in 2011. By April 2013 it handled 70% of the worldâ€™s bitcoin trades.â€¢ Bitcoin Foundation vice chair resigns amid money-laundering investigation",884.0,966.9963,859.0,939.0,13749.64,12643822.27,919.57

2014-01-08,Kanye West's lawyers attempt to block Coinye currency,http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/08/kanye-west-bitcoin-coinye-west-trademark,"A burger stand in east London has become one of the first places in Britain to take Dogecoin, the meme-based cryptocurrency, for physical purchases.Olivier Rynkiewicz started the Bit bourbon steamed burgers stand with his girlfriend Thais Muller in mid January. The stand, based in Brick Laneâ€™s Sunday Up Market, sells burgers steamed in bourbon-infused water â€“ although on the day the Guardian visited, the steam oven was broken, forcing the couple to cook the burgers a more traditional way.Rynkiewicz said that he decided to accept payment in Dogecoin, as well as the more conventional bitcoin, after being told about it by his brother.â€œHe told me about bitcoin when it was still not really worth much. When no one took it seriously. I didnâ€™t at the time, but now we started doing [the stand], and I was thinking, â€˜OK, bitcoin was worth shit at start, it was worth nothing. Now itâ€™s worth, what, $500 or $600?â€™â€œSo I was like, alright, bitcoin could jump so high, why not Dogecoin? And anyway, people have this stuff - bitcoins, dogecoins - but thereâ€™s not many places to use them.â€ùThe burgers sell for Â£5.50 to Â£6.50, but owing to fluctuating exchange rates for cryptocurrencies, the stand has to be more accommodating with users attempting to pay digitally, and owing to a collapse in the Doge/GBP exchange rate over February, the Guardian arrived at the stand with 2,000 too few Dogecoins. (The difference was made up at a later date.)Purchasing is easy with an Android phone and the Dogewallet app, but somewhat harder with an iOS device. Appleâ€™s longstanding policy against bitcoin apps extends to Dogecoin, and so users are forced to make do with web wallets like that at Dogeapi.com. The lack of a QR code scanner on that wallet renders payment tricky, but the problem is surmountable with a second QR reading app.Whichever device is being used, the customer must scan a QR code posted on the stand to get Rynkiewiczâ€™s Dogewallet address, and then type in the amount to send (normally around 8,000 Doge) by hand. The biggest potential hurdle is poor mobile connectivity in the marketplace, a former brewery: all cryptocurrencies require an internet connection for transfers to be completed, and it took several tries to join a 3G network with an iPhone.Rynkiewicz has taken 100,000 Dogecoin at his stand, worth just under Â£70 at current exchange rates. He has no intention to exchange the currency for hard money, however, instead speculating on the chance of appreciation.â€œI donâ€™t cash them out, I store them, because itâ€™s not the main source of income. Thereâ€™s like two or three doge customers a day. So if Iâ€™m going to lose on it later on, if, yeah, if, I can afford it.â€œI do believe itâ€™s going to, not replace the normal currency, but be used really often. This stuff is the future. Hopefully I will be one of the few owners.â€ùDespite offering both dogecoin and bitcoin sales, Rynkiewicz has only sold one burger for bitcoin. He says that of the two currencies, he prefers dogecoin, â€œbecause, like, bitcoin is jumping so high all the time. Now if the price is 500 youâ€™re going to buy something, a burger or something else, and you get home and find itâ€™s worth Â£100 more, two times, three times more. â€œBitcoin is more like investment, more for greedy people.

2014-01-07,Bitcoin me: How to make your own digital currency,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/07/bitcoin-me-how-to-make-your-own-digital-currency,"Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the Zuckerberg-bothering twins who hold around $25m in bitcoin, have launched their own price tracker for the digital currency.Since MtGox, once the most prominent bitcoin exchange, prevented withdrawals in early February, popular sources of data on the currency such as RTBTC have become unreliable. The twinsâ€™ project, â€œWinkdexâ€ù, aims to solve the issue.â€œWe believe that we are establishing an accurate spot price that reflects the true value of a bitcoin and resolves the price confusion that exists due to the various exchanges,â€ù said Cameron Winklevoss, who is the CEO of the company behind Winkdex. His brother, Tyler, is the president of the firm. â€œThe creation of an index that better reflects accurate pricing is the next step in wider acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class,â€ù Cameron added. The index takes an amalgamation of bitcoin prices over six exchanges, including Japanâ€™s MtGox, Britainâ€™s Bitstamp and Bulgariaâ€™s BTC-E. The prices averaged together using a â€œproprietary, patent pending Winkdex formulaâ€ù which takes into account volume and timing of transactions, giving more weight to those which have had more trades in the last two hours.Winkdex will be used internally by the Winklevoss brothers to price their bitcoin holdings, which have never been publicly disclosed. In April 2013, the pair said their holdings amounted to around 1% of all bitcoins in existence; if so, that would equate to an investment of $11m in Aprilâ€™s prices. With the Winkdex showing a price of bitcoin at $592, that means they have more than doubled their money in the interim.In 2004, the twins sued Facebookâ€™s Mark Zuckerberg for $140m, accusing him of stealing their idea for the social network. The case was settled in 2008 for $65m.",1012.88,1044.2,880.0,880.0,22263.98,21388990.09,960.7
2014-01-07,Today's media stories from the papers,http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/07/media-briefing-tuesday-7-january,"First off: House of Cards season two spoiler alert. Don't read if you haven't at least begun the second season.I was asked to keep quiet about my involvement in season two, and I've been sitting on everything for almost a year now. They are very secretive about their story and wanted to make sure no actual spoilers came out before the show. If people found out that I was involved, it could have easily been assumed that they had added a hacker sub-plot in the story. I think if I have to bite my tongue for one more minute, I will literally explode.Beau Willimon, the driving force behind the American House of Cards series on Netflix, approached me last spring to ask if I would do some consulting for the show. He wanted to include a hacker character and some technical sub-plots to the show's second season. He found me after watching Brian Knappenberger's documentary We Are Legion, about the rise of Anonymous as a political force. Without getting into things too much, season two deals with the intersections of a lot of different kinds of power. You'll see a lot of money v political influence as you watch, but through Gavin Orsay's story you can also see the power struggles between journalism, hactivism, and law enforcement. It's a space I've spent a lot of time in, and I was glad to be able to add some verisimilitude to House of Cards depiction of that ground.When I was first introduced to Gavin Orsay, a hacker activist forced to work for the FBI, he already had his wine collection and pet guinea pig, but he hadn't found his moral backbone. Now, I'm not going to go out there and say the final result is a good guy, but initially, he'd committed a cardinal sin of the hacking community: he had betrayed his friends who were fighting the good fight. I explained the significance of that act, how much people in the community would absolutely hate this guy if he went to screen as-is, and I have to say, I was very happy that they chose to make the hacker a more conflicted person fighting to protect some of his friends.One of the things we discussed was how stressful it is for someone in the position that Gavin finds himself in. While I was never in that exact spot, I did have personal experience waiting for the Feds to finally take me to trial for my own technical indiscretions. You can't have a girlfriend when you know you're potentially days away from being locked up for a long time. You can enjoy your money (if your assets haven't been frozen yet), but you can't travel, can't make real connections, can't trust anyone. It's rough. For someone like Gavin, though, who's already gotten involved with the political end of things, the stress is almost unbearable. In my life right now, I have to live knowing that my friends and allies are dropping like flies and there's almost nothing I can do about it. Aaron Swartz, someone I respect deeply who never did anything worthy of a lifetime as a felon, is dead. Andrew Auernheimer is in jail for sharing information AT&T admitted in court to publishing. And my friend, Barrett Brown, is facing 105 years for sharing a link to a hack someone else did. Talking about that stress, the fights that we've lost and the ones we're still fighting, I think is where they got the idea to name drop Barrett Brown in the show. The show is dedicated to apolitical realism, but including him was one little piece of truth that helps to make the world more authentic.Working with Jimmi Simpson, the actor who took on Gavin's role, was an absolute blast. I knew of him already from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia and many other shows, and he reached out to me through Beau almost immediately to start getting an idea of Gavin's head space. Jimmi's not really technical himself (funny, considering one of his other recent roles was another hacker in White House Down), but he was happy to learn as much as I could show him. One of the best things working on House of Cards was fielding all kinds of technical questions from the cast and the crew. AJ Golden, one of their regular IT people, was just great and we spent a lot of time in between takes discussing random topics from graphics tools for use on the show to computer security. Before visiting Baltimore for filming, I was asked for some input on what a hacker's computer setup would look like. It was eerie walking on set for the first time. They hadn't made an exact copy of my setup, of course, but they'd run with the idea in a big way. They even bought a copy of the print I have hanging over my monitors.I was lucky that the show really wanted to get a sense of realism across. This meant that I didn't have to push hard to get software like TOR or Bitcoin into the show. One of the big problems with TV and movies when they address computers and hacking today is just how fake everything seems. I understand the need to wow the viewers with pretty graphics and amazing animations, but at the same time I think that is a disservice to everyone involved. There will probably never be a Gibson-like interface as in the movie Hackers. When you view Gavin's computer screens you can see TOR, IRC (Internet Relay Chat,) command lines and a lot more of what you would actually find in real life.So, how do I feel about the final outcome? There are some concessions that had to be made for keeping things visually interesting, and some things where the story had to take precedence over what was most realistic from a tech standpoint, but nowhere near as many as I was fearing. The iPad scene, which I've seen hollered about on social media, is actually possible with a rooted tablet and some basic app building skills. While Agent Green might seem overly vicious, it's not unheard of for people in law enforcement to cross those lines. As for the fates of the characters? Look at where Barrett is or Private Manning. People who speak out about the abuse of power usually end up paying for it, and the real villains get away with it.",1012.88,1044.2,880.0,880.0,22263.98,21388990.09,960.7
2014-01-06,Malaysian central bank warns against Bitcoin,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/06/malaysian-central-bank-warns-against-bitcoin,"Brands should embrace consumer activismBritons are more likely than ever to take action against companies they're not happy with. New figures from Consumer Action Monitor  reveal that there were 38 million complaints (almost one every second) about products and services in 2013. Without shadow of a doubt, mobile connectivity and the rise of social platforms have produced savvy and outspoken consumers. More and more, consumers are speaking up, either rallying around brands or challenging them on objectionable practices. Consumer activism can break a brand (only 70% of the companies on the Fortune 1000 in 2003 remained on the list in 2013) or make a brand (62% of brand word of mouth is positive, and only 10% negative, according to Keller Fay), and smart companies are embracing it. Remember when Waitrose listened to its customers and put a partnership with Shell on hold? This week Co-op has asked consumers to help it shape its future. And companies like Unilever, Nike, Timberland, IKEA, Divine Chocolate and Kingfisher put trust of its customers and greater good at the heart of what they do. These brands understand that competing just on product and price is no longer enough to connect to the new empowered consumers, and that they need to build long-term engagement through trust. We suggest that in the new era of consumer activism brands need to become PRO-ACTIVE, where 'PRO' (price, product, promotion) is a given, and 'ACTIVE' is what will really set brands apart. 'ACTIVE' stands for Always-on, Community-oriented, Transparent,  Innovative, Vocal/Story-teller and Emotive.Power to young peopleInsight into young people's use of mobile platforms has shone a new light on what for some time has been wrongly considered as a ""disenfranchised"" and ""disinterested"" generation. Young people are actually extremely engaged with the news: according to comscore's January multi-platform report, 89% of under-18 years old mobile internet users and 92% of those aged 18-24 access news sites. Just because they read the news differently from the rest of us (e.g. more 18-24 year old internet users access news sites on mobile devices than PCs) does not mean they are not engaged. The recent study by Populus for think-tank Demos has shown that young people are highly responsible citizens: they are concerned about social issues, keen to volunteer and drink less than previous generations. The app economy powers onThe EU app sector is forecast to generate â‚¬63bn in annual revenue by 2018 and will employ nearly 5m people, according to a new study for the European Commission, summarised by Warc.The study, ""Sizing the EU App Economy"",  found the EU's app economy currently employs 1m developers as well as 800,000 people in marketing and support roles.But this total is expected to grow significantly over the next five years, leading to the employment of 2.7m app developers in 2018 plus 2.1m people in support roles, or 4.8m staff in total.Plenty to do for the young!From the less empowering quartersWith nothing else left to ban Russia bans Bitcoin.

2014-01-06,"Boot up: death of cameras?, tracking solar use, internet growth limits, and more",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/jan/06/electricity-solar-camera,"Why is everyone talking about Venetian royalty?Not that sort of Doge. The one weâ€™re talking about is a meme which grew up on Reddit and Tumblr in the dying months of 2013.It involves superimposing broken English written in multi-coloured Comic Sans on to pictures of shiba inus, a small Japanese breed of dog known for its spirited stubbornness.â€_Why?Why not? Itâ€™s funny. Sometimes.OK. But why do they speak like that in particular?Just as lolcats â€“ the dominant meme of the late 00s â€“ featured cats speaking with their own peculiar grammar, so too do Doges.Key to Doge grammar are the core five modifiers: such, very, many, so, and much; as well as the exclamation â€œwowâ€ù. As for which modifiers are used in which circumstances, thatâ€™s less set in stone. But a good guideline is that if it sounds subtly wrong in English, itâ€™s probably OK in Doge.Wow. Such Doge. So Meme. Photograph: Know Your MemeIs this a bitcoin thing?Ah. Yes. Now weâ€™re getting on to the inevitable second stage in the life of any internet meme: its mutation.Doge has taken the standard twists and turns, and itâ€™s increasingly common to see images which have the format of a Doge picture but donâ€™t actually contain any Shiba Inus at all. But in addition to the evolution of the humour, the meme has been adopted for other projects â€“ of which Dogecoin is the most famous.Dogecoin is a bitcoin â€œforkâ€ù, a project based on the same source code as the original crypto-currency. But a combination of enthusiastic promotors, a good sense of humour, and healthy dose of luck have meant that itâ€™s achieved real-world value, with one Dogecoin worth around a tenth of a penny. That many not sound like much, but it means that establishments like Shoreditchâ€™s BIT Burger stand can sell real goods for the fictional currency. (One steamed burger currently costs 6000 Doge at the market stand, open every Sunday in Brick Lane)How do you actually say â€œdogeâ€ù?Now weâ€™re on to the really controversial questions. The two most popular answers, at least according to a self-selecting poll published by Slate in December, are â€œdohjâ€ù â€“ as in the Venetian rulers â€“ and â€œdogueâ€ù, to rhyme with vogue. But other options, including â€œdoggieâ€ù, â€œdoh-guÃ©â€ù, â€œdog-ehâ€ù and plain old â€œdogâ€ù are all used by various sections of the internet.

2014-01-03,Kanye West inspired Bitcoin alternative to launch next month,http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/03/kanye-coinye-west-bitcoin-coinye-cryptocurrency,"As I write this, I am in Scotland. The streets are quiet. Shopkeepers are not demanding payment in bitcoins. Crowds are not thronging and chanting ""Whaur dare meddle wi' us? Doon wi' Barosso."" All is quiet. Other than in the slightly frosty and literal sense, this does not feel like a Caledonian Spring.But let's begin at one of the very recent and accessible points of sensitivity in Scotland's relationship with her southern neighbour. On Thursday 6 May 2010, the United Kingdom held a general election which, among other things, seemed to indicate that Westminster's financial, intellectual, moral and sexual failings had diminished public confidence to an extent perhaps not seen since the days of the rotten boroughs.A global financial crisis was unfolding and bringing a desperate need for wise, compassionate and imaginative leadership. This seemed unavailable. After a brief flirtation with Nick Clegg's fresh-faced rhetoric, UK voters found themselves unable to raise enough enthusiasm for any party to stave off a Westminster coalition and watched for queasy days while principles were ditched in the pursuit of power.In Scotland, voters woke to discover that even Alex Salmond's desperately foolish doting upon the unconvincing hair and even less convincing finances of Donald Trump couldn't make him look a less promising prospect than business as usual as practised at Holyrood by parties controlled (and tainted) by London's influence. It was a protest vote. But it was also, clearly, the beginning of a process, a conversation one would hope could remain courteous and uninflammatory.And, of course, it gave nationalists the opportunity to call a referendum on independence and to intensify a debate about identity and economic priorities from which one would hope any mature country could always benefit. As it was when Margaret Thatcher's political philosophy proved so very alien to so many in Scotland, this debate has become particularly passionate as austerity imposes so many pressures on a social contract which is held in high esteem north of the border â€“ and which employs a key percentage of the population.And, slowly and quietly, Westminster has begun to brace itself for the Oops Scenario â€“ a narrow, almost accidental, vote in favour of independence heralding massively complex negotiations, staged transitions and escalating expenses. Beyond the attractions of a fresh start and hopes for a parliament that might serve its people, the areas where voters could gather facts upon which to base their referendum decision are notoriously murky. Scots are used to the grubby machinations of their own local politicians and these are hardly more inspiring than those playing out in London. Meanwhile, the future of an independent Scotland is being defined first in the dream worlds of finance, politics and the law. If a decision is made to have confidence in Scotland's economy, it will prosper â€“ if not, mere facts will not save it. Political figures will present reality in terms which suit their own agendas. Lawyers, civil servants and financiers can and will argue any case â€“ for Scottish EU membership, for the union, for use of the Norwegian Krone, for use of cowrie shells.  Figures are conjured to show an independent Scotland thriving, or burning and crashing like a paper lantern.The history of a smaller nation, long governed by a larger one does tend to encourage a sense of being put-upon which, quite naturally, the SNP will seek to exploit. It's easy to frame the current debates on currency and EU status in terms of bullying and paternalism. Whether Scots will rush to judgment is another matter entirely.

We no longer understand what it's worth,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/01/money-corrupted-us-understand-worth,"As flooding continues to paralyse swaths of the UK, farmers face desperate struggles in drought-stricken California and the Philippines rebuilds after the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan, the climate change debate is becoming hard to ignore.Over the past six months we have been exploring the role the financial sector can play when it comes to both tackling the effects of and building resilience to climate change. From developing climate bonds and ploughing money into renewables, to the divestment campaigns spreading across US university campuses.In the run up to an intense period of activity around sustainability, including the UN's climate summit towards the end of the year and the elaboration of the sustainable development goals, we'll be expanding our coverage of how the might of the financial sector can be employed to make the shift towards a more sustainable future.In the light of scandals at the Co-operative Bank and unfavourable headlines over Barclays' bumper bonuses, just what does an ethical bank look like and do we care about ethics when it comes to financial decision-making? It's hoped that efforts to increase accountability and transparency with measures such as integrated reporting frameworks and changes to the listing rules, can help rebuild trust, but there's much to be done. As Saker Nusseibeh has said, if, as it seems, the financial sector is now purely about financial returns, ""better to get some good poker players ... give them the pension money, send them off to Las Vegas."" From disillusionment with the old guard to hope in the new. As the World Economic Forum predicts a $41tn wealth transfer to millennials from the baby boomer generation, how do young people fit into the vision of a sustainable financial system? We've launched a new blog series inviting young people working in, campaigning on or simply interested in sustainable finance to explore this question. In the first post of the series Michael Sidgborn writes ""The next generation of investors think about investing in a fundamentally different way. They are investing to blend profit and purpose.""Plenty of the next generation of investors are involved in financial technology. The explosion of bitcoin and the development of alternative payment mechanisms, suggest a desire to wrest back financial control, and we'll look at what this might mean for sustainable finance. With some of most interesting activity happening outside traditional centres of London and New York, we'll be tracking finacial innovation in countiries such as South Africa, Brazil, Nigeria and China.The finance sector can never be called sustainable until there is true diversity at all levels. Janet Yellen's accession to become the first female head of the Federal Reserve and Christine Lagarde's role at the top of the IMF give hope for a new era of women in finance. Yet according to a recent survey, in the US women make up only 2.7% of chief executives in the financial industry.

Bitstamp, based in Slovenia, and BTC-e, in Bulgaria, also halted withdrawals indefinitely on Wednesday as they came under attack.The moves follow crackdowns by China in December and Russia last week on use of the cybercurrency, which some authorities fear could be used for money laundering, funding terrorism or tax evasion.""This is a denial-of-service [DoS] attack,"" said Jinyoung Lee Englund, a spokeswoman for the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade organisation for exchanges.

2013-12-29,Google's drive into robotics should concern us all,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/29/google-robotics-us-military-boston-dynamics,"A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamIn-app purchases - fool's gold or pay dirt? >> Yankee Group:Their December 2013 survey asked smartphone owners about their app behaviour: â€¢ Two out of three smartphone owners in the US never spend money on app stores.Â 30% of users do not download apps at all; an additional 34% only download free aps and do not spend money on in-app purchases.â€¢ Users that download only free apps will most likely not spend money on in-app purchases.Â Only 12.5% of users who download only free apps will spend money on in-app purchases; this represents 5% of the total number of smartphone owners in the US.â€¢ Users that download paid apps are more likely to spend money on in-app purchases.Â 83% of users that download paid apps will also spend money on in-app purchases; this segment represents 26% of all smartphone users in the US.We estimate that revenue from in-app purchases represent approximately one-third of that coming from paid apps.Anonymity >> Sam AltmanOn the rise of ""Secret"", the app that lets you say things anonymously: I've often thought about the need for an anonymous social network to go along with the fully public and the friends-only ones. But I can't figure out a way to stop an anonymous network from decaying into a Mean Girls-style burn book. If I were running Secret, my number one focus would be to kill every comment about a specific person or company.Â If Secret becomes more of a confessional than a burn-book, it can probably thrive.Anonymity breeds meanness - the Internet has proven this time and time again. People are willing to say nice or neutral things with their name attached - they need anonymity for mean things and things they are embarrassed about.4G smartphone market to boom in China, says IHS >> DigitimesChina's domestic market for 4G smartphones is poised for a massive liftoff in 2014, as shipments grow sixteen-fold from 2013 levels, according to IHS.Shipments of 4G smartphones in China are forecast to reach 72.4m units in 2014, up nearly 1,500% from just 4.6m in 2013, with the market expected to take off after the second half. It will be the first big year for 4G smartphones in only its second year in the country, up from a practically nonexistent base two years ago, IHS noted.The 4G smartphone market in China will see unstoppable growth for the next few years, with shipments doubling to 144.1m units in 2015 and rising another 53% to 219.8m in 2016, IHS projected. Microsoft's mobile muddle >> stratÄ“cheryBen Thompson: Saying ""Microsoft missed mobile"" is a bit unfair; Windows Mobile came out way back in 2000, and the whole reason Google bought Android was fear that Microsoft would dominate mobile the way they dominated the PC era. It turned out, though, that mobile devices, with their focus on touch, simplified interfaces, and ARM foundation, were nothing like PCs. Everyone had to start from scratch, and if starting from scratch, by definition Microsoft didn't have any sort of built-in advantage. They were simply out-executed.Not that that should make Satya Nadella sleep any better at night. The power of mobile is that it is always with you; it is impossible for your mobile device to not dominate your computing time. At first, said time was accretive: on the bus, in the waiting room, the seams in your life. Increasingly, though, mobile is stealing time formerly devoted to PCs, making mobile not just a threat to Microsoft's growth, but also to their cash cows.So, what should it do about it?The pixel density race and its technical merits >> AnandTechJoshua Ho: Going from around 330 PPI to 470 PPI for an LCD IPS display incurs around a 20% power draw increase on the display, which can be offset by more efficient SoC, larger batteries, improved RF subsystem power draw. Such power draw increases can also be offset by improvements in the panel technology used, which has consistently been the case with Samsung's OLED development but regardless of these improvements, it is an increase to power draw compared to an equivalent technology display with lower pixel density. In the case of LCD displays, a stronger backlight must be used as the higher pixel density means the transistors around the liquid crystal become a larger proportion of the display, and the same is also true of OLED panels, but instead the issue becomes that smaller portions of organic phosphors on the display have to be driven at higher voltages in order to maintain the same level of luminance.(Via @tabdump on Twitter.)What the heck is happening to Windows? >> SuperSite for WindowsPaul Thurrott sounds increasingly exasperated: So what does Update 1 add to the mix? This time around, Microsoft has committed what I consider to be the cardinal sin of Windows: It's a return to that age-old issue where Windows simply grew, spaghetti-like, to accommodate every silly possible need of the system's too diverse user group. Now, there are multiple ways to do different things in Metro, too. These previously consistent environmentâ€”like it or loathe itâ€”has finally been put under the committee's knife.Now, some people will see this as ""choice,"" because these changes â€” desktop-like context menus in the Start screen, a desktop-like title bar in Metro apps, and so on â€” will somehow make the system more consistent for them, because they still use traditional PCs. But here's the thing. This mobile environment worked just fine with mouse and keyboard in Windows 8.0 and 8.1, and it was consistent with the touch-based interactions for which the environment was designed. Now? It's a mess.New Apple Mac Trojan called OSX/CoinThief discovered >> SecureMacInitial infection occurs when a user installs and runs an app called ""StealthBit,"" which was recently available for download on GitHub, a website that acts as a repository for open source code. The source code to StealthBit was originally posted on GitHub, along with a precompiled copy of the app for download. The precompiled version of StealthBit did not match a copy generated from the source code, as it contained a malicious payload. Users who downloaded and ran the precompiled version of StealthBit instead ended up with infected systems. A user posting over the weekend on Reddit, the popular discussion site, reported losing 20 Bitcoins (currently worth upwards of $12,000 USD) to the thieves.Sneaky and smart - taking advantage of peoples' trust in repositories but their unwillingness to compile if compiled code is already there. (But would you have checked the code?) To run this on a Mac you'd have to agree to a UAC-style ""trust code from unknown developer"" checkbox. But if you're downloading from a repository, you're already willing to do that.

2013-12-25,"Boot up: why 4K?, phablets rising, Hypponen snubs RSA, and more",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/dec/25/merry-christmas-everyone,"Security researchers have identified a new type of â€œransomwareâ€ù which blocks internet access and turns usersâ€™ computer into a bitcoin miner pending payment of a ransom.The malware, named by researchers at Emsisoft as â€œTrojan-Ransom.Win32.Linkupâ€ù, differs from previous examples of ransomware. â€œIt does not directly lock your computer or encrypt files,â€ù the researchers explain. â€œInstead, Linkup blocks internet access by modifying your DNS and can also turn your computer into a bitcoin mining robot.â€ùWhen an infected computer loads up any page, they are taken to a fake website which accuses them of having viewed â€œchild pornographyâ€ù and demands payment of a â‚¬0.01 fine. The â€œpaymentâ€ù is taken by the user inputting a credit card number, making it extremely unlikely that the malware developers will limit themselves to just one cent; Emsisoft describes it as â€œmost likely a blatant lieâ€ù.Once installed, the malware also attempts to download bitcoin-mining software. When installed, the software uses the computerâ€™s processor to perform the energy-intensive tasks used to mine for bitcoin, which runs the risk of damaging the machine and will certainly run up a large electricity bill.â€œIn the case of Linkup, the most important thing to understand about bitcoin mining is that if a hacker can get more computing power, he can earn more bitcoins,â€ù Emsisoft writes. â€œThatâ€™s why in addition to blocking internet browsing, Linkup also attempts to connect your computer to a bitcoin-mining botnet, which can combine the computing power of multiple infected computers to earn new bitcoins for whoever is behind the attack.â€ùBut while Linkup is a fearsome combination of different types of malware, itâ€™s not the most dangerous to recently hit the internet. Cryptolocker, the virus which recently forced a US police department to pay an Â£800 ransom in bitcoins, has a number of features which render it more concerning than Linkup.Cryptolockerâ€™s modus operandi is to encrypt the victimâ€™s hard drive, and then ask for money â€“ usually two bitcoins â€“ to decrypt it. Because the files really are encrypted, simply removing the virus wonâ€™t help, unlike with Linkup.But the most dangerous thing of all is that many variants of Cryptolocker actually keep their promise, and unlock the files when payment is received. Whereas victims of Linkup have a simple challenge, those infected with Cryptolocker have a much harder decision: do they pay up at all?â€¢ Meet Cody Wilson; creator of the 3D-printed gun, anarchist, libertarian",696.86,710.0,674.0,707.3,5270.7,3669393.68,696.19
2013-12-24,"Tech 128: 2013 was the year of the dark web, Elon Musk and H from Steps",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/24/tech-128-2013-was-the-year-of-the-dark-web-elon-musk-and-h-from-steps,"Having lunch with the 14th Most Dangerous Person in the World is less scary than you might think. Unless you happen to have a morbid fear of hipster beards, Cody Wilson, a good-looking 26-year-old who blends with the crowd in the east London cafe where I meet him, doesn't immediately strike fear into the heart.He chats away with the waitress, discussing the possibilities before ordering east London's hippest sandwich â€“ the pulled pork burger â€“ and has an easygoing, amiable manner. He is, frankly, about as threatening as a barista. A barista who has happened on a spectacular method of killing people.Last year, Wired included him in its list of the deadliest people on the planet, alongside Qassem Suleimani, head of Iran's special forces, and the former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, though Wilson's notoriety is not to do with human rights abuses and killing. It's for uploading a bit of software. A bit of software that could unleash a whole new world: one in which anyone can download a set of blueprints and print their own gun at home.Wilson made news when he unveiled plans for the Liberator in 2012, but in May last year, he went one step further: he successfully fired it, and uploaded the plans on to his website, Defense Distributed. Two days later, the US state department removed them, but by that time they had been downloaded 100,000 times. This is a cat that is well and truly out of the bag. The 3D gun is with us whether we like it or not.Mostly not, I would say. It's a gun. It works. And any nut with access to a 3D printer can print one in the privacy of their bedroom and then â€_ well, you get the picture. The plans include a metal shank so that it'll show up in an x-ray scanner, but it is the work of moments to remove it. And while it is an argument that has a different resonance in the US, where any aforesaid nut can simply go out and buy a gun in a shop, and the rights of nuts to go and buy such guns is enshrined in the constitution, even there, it has caused shockwaves. In Britain, where we hope our robbers carry nothing more than a big stick and arm our police officers accordingly, it's a potential societal revolution that none of us asked for.But then, that's generally the way with societal revolutions. Listening to the radio, just before setting off to meet Wilson, I hear a bulletin that includes the news that the Home Office has updated its firearms rules to make it clear it is illegal to manufacture, sell, purchase or possess 3D printed guns.""Really?"" says Wilson. ""I didn't know about that."" The legislation surrounding 3D guns is moving so fast that it seems not even he is keeping up with it. It follows a news story that a police raid in Manchester uncovered what police believed to be the country's first 3D-printed gun parts. They weren't, it turned out, and we already have plenty of laws that cover guns, 3D or otherwise, but it's a measure of how scary we consider the technology, and how seriously it's being taken, that this is before a single 3D-printed shot has been fired in anger.Though, it is perhaps only a matter of time. The technology is there. Hundreds of thousands of people have downloaded the blueprints. And while the Liberator is made of plastic and exploded when the FBI tried to test it, a Texan company has successfully made a metal versionI've been emailing Wilson for months, and we finally meet while he's visiting Britain and we chat for a few minutes about what he's been doing â€“ picking up a design award, speaking at a conference, being followed around by a documentary crew, talking to publishers. Then before I can stop myself, I ask him the question that eventually everyone asks him: what happens when somebody downloads your design, prints it off and kills someone? When a child is shot with a Liberator?He stumbles a bit and then says: ""Well, I mean, we have to ground it in â€_ I mean it's a hypothetical â€_ People ask me all the time â€_""No, but how would he react?""I want to reserve a space for the humane. I hope I would react humanely. And I hope it would affect me. But does that lead me to apologise for what was done? And I appeal back to standard discussions about respect for civil liberties. What does that mean? It means people will abuse these rights. But what does it mean, as a structural feature, to have access to military weapons as a society? I'm not trying to brush it off but it means accepting people will abuse their liberties, but that's why they deserve protection. If no one is going to abuse a gun, it wouldn't be a right worth protecting. If no one was going to make a speech, we wouldn't need to defend the principle of freedom of speech. The same thing with the right to be secure in your possessions.""The problem with Wilson's argument is that's it's an argument, one that you might formulate in the sixth-form debating society. And on the other side, there would be a dead person. Your mother, perhaps. Or your son who, if it hadn't been for Wilson, and his desire to push the boundaries of internet freedom further, would still be alive. But I can't get through on this point. ",716.99999,729.99174,666.01,702.8,10677.15,7460474.08,698.73

In December, it forced secure messaging app Gliph to remove bitcoin functionality, while BitPak, Bitcoin Express and Coinbase have also entered the graveyard of bitcoin apps.While the company seems to have a consistent stance against Bitcoin apps, it does not provide consistent reasons to the developers themselves about why their apps are being removed.BitPak's developer was told ""that Bitcoin thing is not legal in all jurisdictions for which BitPak is for sale"", while Bitcoin Express was told the app violated rule 22.1 of the company's guidelines, which state that ""apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer's obligation to understand and conform to all local laws"".In April 2012, Blockchain itself was rejected by Apple's moderators in Korea, who told the developers that ""the facilitation of trading of virtual currency is not appropriate for the App Store"".Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn argues that Apple's attacks are ""obfuscation"". ""If Bitcoin wallets were illegal then I wouldn't be working on them, would I?""It's widely known that Apple would like to get into mobile payments, and banning competing apps from the App Store is classic Apple behaviour that they have engaged in many times before. When the App Store was new, they even had an explicit rule saying you couldn't ""duplicate the behaviour"" of Apple's own apps!""If they had a more dominant market position their actions would trigger anti-trust investigations, but because iPhone users can switch to Android, Apple are under less pressure to play fair.""Hearn points to CoinPunk as an option for Bitcoin users who have an iOS device, but says that iPhone usage may be hindering take-up of the currency. ""If you look at Berlin, where there are a huge number of local businesses accepting Bitcoin by now, low iPhone usage is one big reason they've been successful.

2013-12-22,Ten things I hated about business in 2013,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/22/ten-things-i-hated-about-business-in-2013,"US online retailer Overstock's decision to accept payment in Bitcoin has sparked a debate about alternative payment methods. On the first day alone the company raked in 830 orders and over $130,000 (Â£80,000) â€“ but is this a sign of the future success of virtual currencies or was Overstock caught in a bubble of consumer excitement?Either way, there are a number of factors that will define whether cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (or Namecoin, Litecoin and even Dogecoin) will see mainstream success among retailers.Local alternativesLocal payment methods exist in several countries and many of these offer more convenience than something like Bitcoin. For example, Elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren (ELV) or electronic direct debit is widely used in Germany. It's a method of processing direct debits and settled exclusively in euros without the need for a credit or debit card. In Japan, cash on delivery allows customers to pay cash to the carrier at the time an order is delivered. In the Netherlands, some e-tailers offer iDeal, an e-commerce payment system based on online banking.These local payment systems are easy to use and already have widespread trust among their users. Bitcoin and its competitors are similarly virtual but don't have the same ease of use or widespread acceptance. In these markets it's going to be hard for virtual currencies to cut through.TaxBitcoin and its competitors are yet to be defined as either an investment or currency. In the UK, things are being weighed up. HMRC has suggested that it may treat virtual currencies as an investment, meaning that they would be subject to capital gains tax rather than VAT. The IRS in the US is yet to provide an answer. Whether virtual currencies remain a payment option on US websites depends largely on how the IRS classes them. If treated like an investment, then spending virtual currencies in retail stores will trigger a gain or loss by the consumer, therefore making it a less attractive payment option.With China already having banned Bitcoin and the European Banking Authority giving a stark warning of the potential risks for using this currency, it's only going to take two or three more government decisions to make it hard for retailers to see it as a viable alternative payment option.Currency volatilityThe success of international commerce is largely reliant on stable exchange rates. Without a guarantee from a central bank, the volatility of virtual currencies is dangerous for early users. The volatility means retailers will rely heavily on third party online exchange platforms to immediately convert currency into sterling or dollars to ensure the value of the money.Some currency exchange systems charge a low fee of 1% â€“ lower than the fee charged by some visa and debit cards, so retailers won't lose out on revenue earned from a sale. However, there are a large number of websites claiming to be leading exchange systems, so consumers and retailers alike need to be careful when choosing a platform, as not all options will be credible or even legitimate.This also raises many questions: if I purchase goods with Bitcoin at one price, what price will I get if I request a refund at a later date? If I discover fraudulent activity in my e-wallet, how much will I be reimbursed? Overstock has answered the question of returns by offering in-store credit instead of Bitcoins or cash, but it's not clear whether the credit will appear as a cash or Bitcoin value.SecurityAs the name suggests, cryptocurrencies ensure optimum privacy, which has in the past made them attractive currencies for buyers and sellers of illegal goods. Retailers must be wary of taking such payments from anonymous sources. Can the buyer be trusted? If it's a big transaction, is it a sign of fraud? Bitcoin and its competitors' lack of governance mean there are no anti-money laundering controls, making it more attractive for criminals to set up fraudulent accounts.The attraction of Bitcoin mining in particular has opened a new frontier for online criminal activity. Most recently malware was served in ads on the Yahoo homepage for four days, turning the PCs of users visiting the site into a ""bitnet"" â€“ a power source for mining the virtual currency.Novelty v familiarityBitcoin's reputation needs to improve to ensure that it's not just seen as a novelty payment method by consumers. Building trust in its brand will be key to its long-term success. The recent money laundering allegations leading to the resignation of Bitcoin Foundation's vice president, Charlie Shrem, hasn't helped its cause either. Building trust in its brand will be key to its long term success, which may now take longer than previously anticipated.Darryl Adie is managing director of Ampersand CommerceGet more articles like this sent direct to your inbox by signing up for free membership to the Guardian Media Network â€“ this content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. ",636.09001,700.0,615.0,639.48,11501.33,7603966.93,661.14

""The indictment was expected and does not contain any new factual allegations,"" Dratel said in a statement.Ulbricht was arrested late last year. Authorities say he operated the Silk Road website under the name Dread Pirate Roberts. The website allowed users to anonymously browse nearly 13,000 listings.Authorities say the categories included cannabis, psychedelics and stimulants. Purchases were made using the virtual currency Bitcoin.Ulbricht was arrested on 1 October in a public library in San Francisco, shortly after authorities shut down Silk Road, which vendors and customers accessed using an encryption program that strips internet users' identifying information to allow them to communicate anonymously with each other.Ulbricht has maintained his innocence through statements by his lawyer.The indictment by a grand jury marks the end of an initial period during which Ulbricht could have talked with prosecutors and made a deal to soften any sentence rendered against him by pleading guilty and co-operating.",649.393,689.99,610.0,640.5,14441.48,9356525.82,647.89
2013-12-20,Beyond Bitcoin: some alternative marketplaces lend social empowerment,http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/business-model-innovation-e-choupal-onemorepallet-sirum-alternative-marketplaces,"   The vice-president of the Bitcoin Foundation, which lobbies on behalf of the digital currency, has resigned  amid allegations he helped launder money for Silk Road, the online drug bazaar.Charlie Shrem, 24, who is one of the digital currencyâ€™s highest-profile faces, was arrested by US authorities at John F Kennedy airport in New York on Sunday as part of the ongoing investigation into Silk Road, a now-closed online store that allegedly dealt in drugs, guns and other contraband items.The arrest came as a major blow to the Bitcoin Foundation, which has been lobbying for greater acceptance in Washington for the digital currency and testified before the Senate last year in an attempt to dispel the perception that the currency is linked to organised crime.Shrem is also the chief executive officer of BitInstant, a Bitcoin exchange company that attracted investment from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, famous for their early involvement with Facebook and now two of Bitcoinâ€™s biggest backers. BitInstant aims to widen Bitcoin ownership and allows people to buy the digital currency in over 700,000 locations.Jon Matonis, the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, which is a non-profit organisation, said: â€œAs a foundation, we need to remain focused on our core mission to standardize, protect, and promote the Bitcoin core protocol. While Charlie has contributed a great deal of personal effort and resources to enhance the adoption of Bitcoin worldwide, a prolonged legal dispute would inevitably detract from advancing that core mission.""Therefore, in order to focus on his pending trial, it has been mutually decided that Charlie Shrem resign from the board of directors, effective immediately.""On Monday, Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, alleged that Shrem helped Robert Faiella, who was charged alongside him, to sell more than $1m-worth of bitcoins to Silk Road customers. Faiella, a 52-year-old Florida man whom Shrem had never met, allegedly ran an underground Bitcoin exchange using the alias BTCKing.In a blogpost, the Bitcoin Foundation pointed out that Bharara had said: â€œThe charges contained in the complaint are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.""It continued: â€œWe are both surprised and saddened to learn of these allegations. The foundation does not condone illegal activities and values transparency, accountability and a high level of responsibility towards its members and overall community.â€œIt is also worth noting that the indictment itself is not against Bitcoin or the community at large.

""For cars to be able to self-drive, they have to be able to negotiate with each other. You can't negotiate something like that without having some security principles behind it. So cars have to do basic things that we do with each other, like recognise each other â€“ authentication.""OK, I authenticate to you, that means there has to be an underlying artefact, a certificate or something like it that says 'you're an authorised car, and I'm an authorised car, therefore we can exchange this information really fast.' And you stop and I turn.Schwartz described ""a million applications"" in the car industry alone designed for machine-to-machine communications with potentially a millionÂ underlying security issues.Even normal cars are susceptible to hacking attacks. In August, a pair of researchers demonstrated attacks on a Ford SUV and Toyota Prius which enabled them to slam on the brakes, jerk the steering wheel, or accelerate the car using a laptop plugged into the the diagnostics port.In 2011, a different team of researchers managed to penetrate similar systems through bluetooth, mobile data and even a malicious audio file burned onto a CD played in the car's media player.But self-driving cars have many more avenues of communication with the outside world, and â€“ definitionally â€“Â less oversight from a driver to correct any errors.A ransom for your medical data?As well as self-driving cars, Eddie Schwartz cautioned that the entire field of machine-to-machine communications, also known as ""the internet of things"", presents an enticing target to hackers.""How many IP-based [internet connected] devices does the average person have in their home today? Most people can't even count them. If you ask them, they would probably say 'oh, I have two computers and a whatever', but the reality is it's probably more like 20 to 30 if they start thinking about itâ€_ You're going to see a spill from 4 or 5bn IP devices to hundreds of billions over the next 10 years.""Schwartz cautioned that with the growth of new devices and services in the health space the potential for malicious hacks will grow exponentially, including devices that gather intimate personal medicalÂ data.""These are going to be embedded solutions.Â It's going to be wireless communications or NFC. These are machine-to-machine communications, and for critical care, they are going to have telemetry going on 24/7.""There's an underlying security and privacy issue: imagine ransom-ware [software such as Cryptolocker that breaks devices and demands a fee to fix them] in that world.""â€¢Â US police force pay bitcoin ransom in Cryptolocker malware scam",730.0,774.47,621.25001,650.0,34364.27,23999605.66,698.39
2013-12-20,"2013, everything you need to know â€“ infographic",http://www.theguardian.com/culture/picture/2013/dec/20/2013-infomania,"A senior figure in the Bitcoin Foundation, which lobbies on behalf of the digital currency  has been arrested for conspiracy to commit money laundering and â€œknowingly contributingâ€ù to anonymous drug sales.Prosecutors announced on Monday that Charlie Shrem, the organisation's vice chairman, was arrested at John F Kennedy airport in New York on New York Sunday. The news comes as a major blow for the digital currency lobby group and its supporters including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The twins, famous for the early involvement with Facebook, have become big backers of the digital currency. They said in a statement on Monday that they were â€œdeeply concernedâ€ù by the news.A second man, Robert Faiella, has also been arrested and charged for the same crimes relating to his operation of a small bitcoin exchange under the name BTCKing.The charges, unsealed by the US attorney for the southern district of New York,  Preet Bharara, accuse the pair of ""engaging in a scheme to sell over $1m in bitcoins to users of Silk Road"", the online black marketplace which was closed by the FBI in October 2013.Shrem has been one of the highest profile executives on the Bitcoin Foundation. His arrest comes as staff at the foundation have been working hard to distance the digital currency from its links to crime, testifying to the US Senate last year and been lobbying regulators in Washington. Patrick Murck, Bitcoinâ€™s general counsel, said: â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s damaging for the Foundation. [The] foundation wasnâ€™t involved in any of the allegations.â€ùJames Hunt, an agent at the US drug enforcement administration agent, said in a statement: ""The charges announced today depict law enforcement's commitment to identifying those who promote the sale of illegal drugs throughout the world. Hiding behind their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along the way.""The charges stem from Shrem's ownership of the BitInstant bitcoin exchange, of which he is the chief executive, co-founder and compliance officer. The exchange hit the headlines in May 2013 when the Winklevoss twins led a seed round which raised $1.5m of investment. The timing of the charges is unfortunate for the Winklevoss brothers who are set to speak this week at a two-day conference on digital currencies held by New York state's department of financial services.In a statement the twins said: â€œWhen we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws â€“ including money laundering laws â€“ and we expected nothing less.  Although BitInstant is not named in todayâ€™s indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest.  We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials. We fully support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money laundering requirements are enforced, and look forward to clearer regulation being implemented on the purchase and sale of bitcoins.â€ùShrem is additionally charged with ""wilfully failing to file any suspicious activity report regarding Faiella's illegal transactions through the company,"" the documents reveal.â€œAs alleged, Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over $1m in Bitcoins to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics onï¿_ï¿_ï¿_ï¿_ï¿_ the dark web drug site, Silk Road,"" said Bharara. ""Truly innovative business models donâ€™t need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.â€ùThe substance of the allegation is that Faiella offered bitcoins for sale on the Silk Road website, a move which would entail knowing of their involvement in the drugs trade. Those bitcoins were purchased from the Bitinstant exchange.Shrem, as the compliance officer of the exchange, was in charge of ensuring its compliance of anti-money laundering rules. The charges, delivered by an IRS agent who was assigned to the New York organised crime drug enforcement strike force, allege that ""not only did Shrem knowingly allow Faiella to use the company's services to buy bitcoins for his Silk Road customers, he personally processed Faiella's transactions, gave Faiella discounts on his high-volume orders, wilfully failed to file suspicious activity reports about Faiella and deliberately helped Faiella circumvent the company's [anti-money-laundering] restrictions, even though it was Shrem's job to enforce them.""In December 2013, Shrem was profiled by news website Vocativ in a piece titled ""My Night Out With Bitcoin Millionaire and Proud Stoner Charlie Shrem"". In it, Shrem tells reporter Eric Markowitz that ""I wonâ€™t hire you unless I drink with you or smoke weed with you"", and says that he was forced to temporarily close BitInstant several times due to increased regulatory scrutiny. ""If we want to exist 20 years from now, we want to make sure all of our ducks are in a row,â€ù he tells Markowitz, â€œand right now, theyâ€™re not.""The Winklevoss brothers' investment in BitInstant is just a small part of their total investment in bitcoin and related companies. Following the news of Shrem and Faiella's arrest, the price of bitcoin on the Mtgox exchange dropped by 3%.",730.0,774.47,621.25001,650.0,34364.27,23999605.66,698.39
2013-12-19,"Boot up: mobile scale, Titan's work, webcam spying, Bitcoin woes and more",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/dec/19/mobile-internet-scale,"A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamOn the Matter of Why Bitcoin Matters >> The Magazine on MediumGlenn Fleishman responds to Marc Andreesen, who has been talking up the wonders of Bitcoin; Fleishman is less sure, having researched it closely. Bitcoin doesn't eliminate fraudulent transactions; it only eliminates counterfeit payments. This can, of course, save many tens or hundreds of billions of dollars a year globally and translate to more efficiency in commerce. But removing the intermediary also removes recourse outside of courts, and the cost and nature of that can't be determined.Because Bitcoin is like untraceable cash, the process for solving a dispute would likely follow the same rules as for cash. When a transaction occurs over the Internet, the odds of recovering one's Bitcoins when a seller fails to meet his or her obligations is the same as if you'd sent a wad of bills in an envelope through the mail.Battle of the Box >> stratÄ“cheryBen Thompson compares Dropbox (consumer-oriented) with Box (enterprise-oriented): Dropbox's model makes sense theoretically, but it ignores the messy reality of actually making money. After all, notably absent from my piece on Business Models for 2014 was consumer software-as-a-service. I'm increasingly convinced that, outside of in-app game purchases, consumers are unwilling to spend money on intangible software. That is likely why Dropbox has spent much of the last year pivoting away from consumers to the enterprise.There are multiple reasons why the latter is a more attractive target for all software-as-a-service companies, especially those focused on data:The implication, if you follow this line of thought through, is that all that lovely free space on Dropbox is going to stop as it seeks customers who will pay. (Thompson responds: ""I doubt the Dropbox freemium will go away, FWIW [for what it's worth]."")Why VMware spent $1.54bn on AirWatch >> CITEworldPalador co-founder Benjamin Robbins, whose firm helps clients build their mobile strategies, says it is both the end and beginning of an era. ""It's the end of an era because AirWatchÂ equals MDM [mobile device management]. MDM can no longer be a point solution and must be part of a larger EMM [enterprise mobile management] framework,"" he explained. ""At the same time, it's the beginning of an era because security firms must have a reputable MDM component as part of the their EMM strategy,"" he said.Jack Gold, principal at mobile research firm Jack Gold and Associates, added that VMware was struggling mightily in the mobile space and purchasing AirWatchÂ gives them a fighting chance. He said that VMware specifically brought Sanjay Poonen on board from SAP to give the unit a lift and AirWatch fills in some blanks and brings a growing customer base with them.AirWatch, MobileIron and Good Technology all offer technologies for controlling smartphones in enterprise environments - in effect, they compete with the non-handset aspect of BlackBerry.Windows 8 is worse than Vista (for Microsoft) >> Tech.pinionsSteve Wildstrom: I think Microsoft really should pull the two halves of Windows 8 apart and come out with two operating systems (or at least two user interfaces, not quite the same thing), each optimized for its own usage. Tablets should get a touch interfaceâ€“son of Metro. Traditional PCs, likely to be the smaller market in the future, need a UI designed to work primarily with a keyboard and a pointing device, and that would probably look more like legacy Windows than Metro.I'm not convinced there is much of a future for touchscreen notebooks. I have used Windows 8 and 8.1 on both conventional clamshell touch notebooks and convertibles of varied design and I am not convinced that any of them come close to a MacBook. In fact, running Windows on a MacBook is a superior experience to most Windows notebooks because of the superiority of Apple's touchpad.The big question is just what will make a Windows 9 tablet an attractive proposition? The answer has to be what Microsoft has always thought it was: Office. From quantified self to qualified house >> Arousing the Buy CuriousBecki Saltzman looks a little further ahead on Nest: In real estate, sellers disclose and buyers beware. Disclosure laws differ state-to-state and so, too, does the buyer burden to figure out exactly what they're buying. Nest products could be a game-changer. Now the thermostat reveals heating and cooling inefficiencies. Now the smoke detector becomes a radon detector, a mold detector, a moisture detector. If those levels are found on the sellers' smart phone and the seller didn't disclose those details to a potential buyer, what recourse might a buyer have? How is the seller to know what is important to disclose once the Internet of Things is able to measure all sorts of things? Should the seller give the buyer access to the application where they can download every measurement every gadget provides?If a seller likes cutting edge coolness and is one of the first to install the new Nest products, does that seller have a greater responsibility to disclose just because they are now aware of a greater number of measuredâ€_things? Will buyers decide that a seller is hiding something and choose to buy only homes that have measurements for everything that is possible to measure?Surely this will be an episode thread in Modern Family very soon.Video: how to cancel email with Gmail's Undo Send feature >> TIME.comIt's a Google Labs feature (remember Google Labs?) that you can still implement.

2013-12-18,UK unemployment rate tumbles to four and a half-year low - as it happened,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/18/uk-unemployment-bank-minutes-federal-reserve-business-live,"Programmers famously have to balance their technical concepts with the needs of the human beings on which their projects rely. Too often, anÂ engineer's tunnel-vision means they end up focusing on the stuff that can be fixed, and abstract away the rest.Â The latest example can be found in Bitcloud, a software project announced breathlessly to Reddit as aiming to ""replace YouTube, Dropbox, Facebook, Spotify, ISPs, and more with decentralised apps"".Nobody can accuse the Bitcloud team of aiming low. Their proposal â€“ which currently exists only in draft form â€“Â is nothing less than an entire shadow internet, built using a heavily modified version of the bitcoin protocol.Where bitcoin uses a ""proof of work"" system, requiring users to demonstrate that they have spent processing power before they can verify transactions, Bitcloud proposes a ""proof of bandwidth"" equivalent, rewarding users for providing capacity to the network.The Bitcloud project is in such early days that it has yet to decide quite what proof of bandwidth actually entails, but the team is confident they will flesh out the white spaces.In principle, there's little reason why they shouldn't succeed. The biggest leap has already been made by bitcoin, which demonstrates that a network with no centralisation can work even without any trust between members.Bitcloud promises to ""replace many of the centralised applications on the current internet, such as YouTube, Dropbox, Facebook, Spotify, and others with decentralised, open-source alternatives.Decentralising the internet""We will have to start by decentralising the current internet, and then we can create a new internet to replace it. If you're interested in privacy, security, ending internet censorship, decentralising the internet, and creating a new mesh network to replace the internet, then you should join or support this project.""But Bitcloud isn't the first to attempt to replace major aspects of the internet with a decentralised network; in 2010, Diaspora raised over $200,000 on Kickstarter to build a peer-to-peer replacement for centralised social networks. Anyone can run a disapora ""node"", hosting their data on a server under their control, neatly sidestepping issues of copyright and monetization. Users can also join nodes run by others.But Diaspora solved an interesting technological problem without dealing with the people at its heart. The project is still ongoing â€“ in fact, version 0.3.0.1 was released on TuesdayÂ â€“Â but has been struggling to scale. It turns out that people prefer social networks which all their friends are on, and that innovative technological solutions to problems of privacy are rarely enough to overcome that hurdle.Bitcloud has the same problem but magnified tenfold. Diaspora nodes are, at least, accessible to those who aren't on the network, so that if you were to share photos there, others could see them, although they couldn't interact unless they also joined a Diaspora node. By contrast, Bitcloud nodes are invisible unless the user is also running Bitcloud.We now have the technology to build a fully decentralised, impossible to censor second internet with no content on it and no one using it. But the future's going to be some time coming.â€¢ eBay clamping down on UK bitcoin sales",715.0,717.015,455.0,541.00001,109722.89,62048984.58,565.51
2013-12-18,Bitcoin plummets as China's largest exchange blocks new deposits,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/18/bitcoin-plummets-china-payment-processors-digital-cryptocurrency,"eBay UK is to limit sales of bitcoin to its classified advertising platform from February 10, banning the currency from its auction and buy-it-now formats.After the change comes into force, merchants will only be able to sell bitcoin through the classified ads format, which requires the buyer to contact the seller directly, without obligation.""To promote a trustworthy marketplace and ensure compliance with applicable regulations, eBay is currently updating its currency policy,"" the site said in a statement. ""The updated policy will clarify that listings for Bitcoin and other similar virtual currencies must be listed in the virtual currency category in the classified ad format.""The virtual currency category is expected to be available on the UK site on February 10th.""Bitcoin transactions are unusual in that they are (comparatively) instantaneous and irreversible. Under eBay's normal auction rules, this could leave the site open to fraud, with a buyer purchasing bitcoins and then refusing to pay, or initiating a credit-card chargeback. By switching to the classified ads model, where users pay for an ad up front and eBay takes no part in settling the deal, the site removes itself from the risky end of the transaction.Bitcoin is not currently covered by any of the site's policies, and since the site does not specify items which are allowed to be sold, only those which are prohibited or restricted from sale, that means that until now the currency has been traded relatively freely. One merchant is selling bitcoins in 0.02 BTC increments for Â£15.99; another, claiming to be the ""cheapest on eBay"", sells the same for Â£24.99.At the current exchange rate, 0.02 BTC is worth around Â£12, which might explain why the majority of bitcoin-related sales are for computer hardware called ASIC miners. These are specialised chips that allow users to ""mine"" bitcoin more efficiently than if they just use a normal computer.Despite the fact that the changes in policy massively reduce the scope for bitcoin trading using the eBay platform, many organisations, including This Is Money and ZDnet have reported the news as a positive step for the currency.While many high-up staff at eBay's executive team have said nice things about bitcoin, with PayPal's president David Marcus saying ""we're believers in BTC"", Bitcoin fans may conclude the acts speak for themselves.â€¢ Holocaust memorabilia removed from sale on eBay",715.0,717.015,455.0,541.00001,109722.89,62048984.58,565.51
2013-12-17,Today's media stories from the papers,http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/17/media-briefing-tuesday-17-december,"A group of supporters has raised more than $25,000 in the internet currency Dogecoin to let the Jamaican bobsleigh team attend the Winter Olympics in Sochi.On Sunday, news broke that the team had qualified for the Winter Olympics for the first time since 2002. The two-man sled will be piloted by Winston Watt, a 46-year-old Jamaican-American who also competed in 2002, with Marvin Dixon as the brakeman.But Watt revealed that, even after putting his own money up to fly the team to his training session, there wasn't enough money to send the two to Russia. As a result, he turned to donations, launching a PayPal account to pay for the estimated $40,000.The Jamaican bobsleigh team achieved international fame after qualifying for the 1988 Winter Olympics with a team of four men who had very little experience in the sport. That fame was boosted with the release of Cool Runnings in 1993, a loosely fictionalised account of their trials. The film remains a cult hit, and fans spread word of Watt's plight.One of them was Liam Butler, who runs the Dogecoin foundation along with the currency's initial creators Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus. Dogecoin is a crypto-currency, based on a combination of bitcoin, the popular digital money, and Doge, the internet meme that superimposes broken English written in Comic Sans onto pictures of Shiba Inu dogs.""As someone who grew up in the 90's, Cool Runnings was the ultimate feel good movie about underdogs out of their element achieving their dreams,"" Butler told the Guardian. ""When I was about 7 years old, my best friend and I had a billy-cart that his dad built. When we would start our run down his driveway, we would shout out the catchphrase from the movie: 'Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up, it's bobsled time!'""On Monday in Sydney, where he lives, Butler launched Dogesled, aiming to raise some of the money required to send Watt and Dixon to Sochi. ""We started without a concrete plan in mind,"" Butler says. ""I sent a few emails outâ€_ but that was the extent of it.""Within a few hours, however, the fundraiser had collected just over 26m Dogecoins. So many people had been donating, in fact, that they seemed to raise the price of the currency itself; in 12 hours, the Dogecoin to Bitcoin exchange rate rose by 50%.""Myself and Jackson Palmer (the creator of Dogecoin) were at a local pub trivia in Sydney when we noticed the value of Dogecoin had more than doubled since we'd last checked so we raced back to my house to ensure we could get the best price for the donations in a form the team could actually use. As much as we have faith in Dogecoin to become the community currency of the internet, we still understand that the team need to buy their airfares in a fiat currency.""At the exchange rate Butler secured, he has $25,000 ready to send to the bobsleigh team, and the donations continue to flood in. It looks like the Jamaican bobsleigh team might be going to Sochi.â€¢Â US prosecutors ponder what to do with multimillion-dollar Bitcoin hoard",760.0,780.0,678.8904,715.0,31284.06,22608843.58,722.7
2013-12-17,What will happen if countries carve up the internet?,http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/dec/17/internet-fragmentation-eugene-kaspersky,"When did you hear of Bitcoin? The first transaction involving the digital currency was just four years ago â€“ believed to be a Briton paying a programmer in Florida for a pizza. But Americans are embracing this form of computer-generated money so fast you can now use it to buy a ticket to the ball game â€“ as well as a flight into space with Virgin Galactic.What new financial instrument will we be writing about come 2020? We just don't know â€“ and it is this hectic pace of change in finance that poses the greatest challenge to Labour's proposals to break up the banks.Ed Miliband's argument is that the main problem with banks is they have become more and more concentrated, and that capping their size, and giving two new players an 8% market share each by carving up the existing players, will ensure they start serving us rather than themselves.Let's put aside the fact that Virgin Money (carved out of Northern Rock) or the new TSB (awarded 4.5m accounts broken off from Lloyds) have hardly turned high street banking upside down. Or that the ""big four"" has for long been a misnomer, with Santander, Nationwide and Halifax all competing furiously for our current accounts.There is already a very different revolution going on in banking, but it's not in the branches on our high streets or even in our wallets. By the time Miliband's competition shake-up could come into effect, the current vogue for filling the branch with iPads, the chip-enabled debit and credit cards in your wallet, even contactless payment cards, could look as quaint as writing out a cheque with a fountain pen does now.Take Zapp, for example. It's a new app that is working with major banks and retailers (WH Smith and McDonald's have signed up already) that from next summer will allow shoppers to pay at the till with their smartphone. Its proponents believe it will allow us all to leave our wallets at home. Then take Zopa. It's the pioneer of peer-to-peer lending, which uses the internet to cut out the banks entirely. It matches savers with individuals who want to borrow, leaving out the bank and offering better rates all round. It has grown rapidly in recent years, joined by rivals such as Funding Circle that use the same model to match savers with business borrowers.In the US, the biggest peer-to-peer firm, Lending Club, has already sourced $3bn in loans and found an avid backer in Google, which snapped up a stake in the firm last May. And then, like it or loathe it, the technology company that is transforming the financial landscape in Britain is Wonga.com. It has already joined the ranks of the biggest lenders in the UK, handing out one million loans last year.Mobile banking, after a slow start, has skyrocketed over the past year and with smartphones soon to be ubiquitous across all generations, the forecasts about the end of conventional branch banking no longer look so far-fetched. When Labour talks of breaking up the banks to increase competition and let new challengers into the marketplace, it risks fighting yesterday's battles.There was once a cosy high-street banking cartel with barriers that effectively prevented customers switching accounts to upstart rivals. But technology makes switching accounts today far easier.Yet the number of account holders moving their accounts remains relatively low. It is not the real or apparent barriers that deter people from moving their money, nor is it a lack of other places to go â€“ it is an entirely rational apathy. There's very little incentive to do so â€“ a 50-quid bonus here or an M&S voucher there. More independent banks on the high street will do nothing to change that.There is another part of the banking system that remains deep frozen: lending to small- and medium-sized businesses. And if Labour wants to tackle that then breaking up the existing giants will be merely a distraction. Already, many businesses are tapping the bond market for funds, not through traditional stockbrokers but with online retail bond offers direct to small investors. The market has gone from virtually zero to Â£1bn last year, according to Capita, and it is projected to grow to Â£8bn a year by 2017.Labour is right to want to intervene in the dysfunctional market for small business loans, and to redirect schemes such as Funding for Lending towards manufacturing and industry rather than property. But there are technologically more imaginative opportunities and challenges than simply breaking up the banks.",760.0,780.0,678.8904,715.0,31284.06,22608843.58,722.7

2013-12-16,Geek deemed word of the year by the Collins online dictionary,http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/16/geek-word-year-collins-dictionary-definition,"Porn.com has seen sales increase by nearly a quarter since it started accepting payments in bitcoin, leading the site to claim that porn could be the currency's ""killer app"".Now the site's owners are offering the domain for sale to anyone who will pay $50m in the digital currency.Porn.com started taking bitcoin for its premium services in December, and the currency rapidly came to account for 10% of its sales. But in early January, a post on Reddit's Bitcoin subforum took the news viral, and after a spike where the currency accounted for 50% of its sales, the bitcoin trade settled down at 25%.Some of the increase will be bitcoin fans rushing to support a site that takes their preferred form of payment, but David Kay, the marketing director at Porn.com's parent company Sagan Ltd, argues that there are other reasons as well:""Privacy and confidentiality are paramount when joining an adultÂ service for the majority. In general you can surf porn.com for free, anonymously but if you want to upgrade to the premium services you have to enter a method of payment which historically has been credit card. In order for the transaction to process you have to include your full name and address. This is not necessary with BTC.""Some aspects of bitcoin are less useful, however. It is currently impossible to set up recurring payments with the currency, making it impractical for subscriptions that renew on a short term basis.Additionally, while transaction fees are a contentious topic among bitcoin users, when they are levied it is on an absolute basis, rather than a proportion of the purchase: a typical fee of 0.0001 BTC is only economical for purchases of more than around Â£2. But Kay is not concerned:""Our experience has been positive using BTC for smaller payments. I think the general public as a whole doesn't yet know that you can spend just a portion of a bitcoin on a purchase. Our customers are using bitcoins to buy premium services and to tip our live performers.Ever since the conflict between VHS and Betamax, take-up by the porn industry has been seen as key to the success of consumer technologies. One version of tech lore has it that JVC's welcoming attitude towards adult content on VHS was the reason it won out in the end.Whether or not that was true three decades ago â€“Â a more believable explanation is that VHS was the only one of the formats which could hold an entire feature film on one cassette â€“ Kay hopes that it will hold out this time round:""I definitely believe that porn will be bitcoin's killer app. Fast, private and confidential payments.""The marketing director added that the porn.com business is currently up for sale, ""for $50m, payable in bitcoin only. So if I look at the trading amount today, that would roughly be 55,370 bitcoins.""In 2007, porn.com became one of the most expensive domain names ever sold, when Detroit-based MXN Ltd paid $9.5m to buy it.At the time, only sex.com had sold for more, after an auction in 2005 ended at $12m. The site is ranked by analytics firm Alexa as the 894th most visited website in the world, and the 576th most-visited in the UK.â€¢ Ware, Hertfordshire: the porn capital of Britain?",916.0,925.0,714.11,760.0,40795.65,32476301.78,796.07
2013-12-15,"I'm sorry, but we've got to stop apologising | Ian Martin",http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/15/sorry-stop-apologising-ian-martin,"Barring a few changes â€“ such as chip-and-pin technology, contactless payments â€“ the standard mix of loyalty cards, credit and debit cards, and cash in a wallet is much the same as it was 20 years ago. But there's a big prize waiting for the first company to convince us to ditch all our metal and plastic for something more 21st century. Here's what you need to know about the groups jostling for position in your back pocket.1 The big threeA small group has taken the lead in digital payments online: Google, Amazon and PayPal. Now they are trying to build their businesses in the physical world. Google's Wallet service lets users put cash on their phone to spend in-store as well as online. And, with near field communication technology, it turns a compatible Android phone into a contactless card.2 Google Wallet's real walletIf your favourite coffee shop isn't hooked in to Google's system, the company has also just released a physical Wallet Card, which lets you spend your balance anywhere in the US where Mastercard is accepted. It's basically just another debit card but hooked up to the Bank of Google.3 The Coin cardThe aim of the $100 Coin, launching in the US in the summer, is to allow one card to do the job of every other one in your pocket, from debit cards to supermarket loyalty cards. It scans the magnetic strip on the back of the cards, and then replicates the strip electronically on its own back. With the click of a button, you can switch from paying with a debit card to paying with a credit card and back â€“ and even swipe for loyalty points in between.4 SquareDigital wallets have a chicken-and-egg problem: they're useless to customers without shops which take them, and no shop will accept payment in them if their customers don't use them.Square, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey's new company, provides small businesses with an appendage that plugs into the headphone jack of a mobile phone and allows merchants to swipe cards and take payments. But Dorsey's real goal is removing cards altogether. Every merchant using Square to take card payments can also take payments directly from the Square app on customers' phones â€“ and thanks to a high-profile deal with Starbucks, that's now quite a few customers.5 USGoogle's Wallet Card, Coin and Square are unavailable outside the US. There are the standard commercial pressures to blame, plus in the UK we've moved to a chip and pin system. That is significantly more secure than the magnetic stripes still used in the US, but also harder to programme for. It's doubtful that something like the Coin card could exist with chip and pin payments, for instance.6 iZettleSome companies are dealing with chip and pin. Stockholm's iZettle lets stores use an iPhone or iPad to take credit card payments, but the more complex technology comes at a cost: whereas PayPal and Square offer free mag-stripe readers in the US, iZettle's chip and pin reader costs almost Â£100, as does PayPal's competing hardware.7 NFC paymentsMobile phones that can carry out contactless payments have been available in the UK since 2011, but the technology hasn't taken off. Phones with the required technology are still quite rare. And most of the services require you to set up a separate digital wallet, rather than linking directly to your bank account, adding an extra layer of bureaucracy between you and your money.8 Horrible fragmentationEvery company has its own, non-transferrable, digital wallet app. In 2014 some of that fragmentation should end as Vodafone, EE and O2 form a mobile wallet service, ""Weve"". But the days of digital wallets being as straightforward as credit cards seem a long way off.9 BitcoinDespite news stories about bitcoin being illustrated with shiny metallic discs, bitcoins are simply chunks of data on a hard drive that can be bought with ""real"" money or them by getting a computer to chug through some complex maths. Their fully digital nature gives them potential as an international currency, and allows users to transfer them between each other without having to go through banks.10 The elephant in the roomSome suspect Apple has a plan up its sleeve: a combination of its vast horde of credit card data, Touch ID fingerprint scanners and new ""iBeacon"" technology for short-distance communications could create a fearsome competitor.",900.005,928.0,838.0201,920.0,15038.57,13186844.81,876.87

2013-12-12,George Osborne faces the Awkward Squad of Steel,http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/12/george-osborne-andrew-tyrie-sketch,"Kanye West has reached the stage of celebrity where he has simply too much cash with his name on it. The launch of a new cryptocurrency called Coinye was hastily fast-tracked this week, after a predictable  backlash from the rapper's lawyers, who claim the Bitcoin alternative is an infringement of West's trademark.Coinye's creators responded to the legal team's demands in the most middle-finger way possible, by changing the chiselled image of his face on the coin to that of a cartoon fish in grilled sunglasses, with silly hair. The coin is now available, proliferating over peer to peer networks beyond the reach of the law.But aside from Kanye's run-in with the money makers, there are other artists who seem much more willing to embrace the exchange: in December, rap kingpin Snoop Dogg tweeted that his new album would be ""available in Bitcoin and delivered in a drone"" and none other than Mel B announced that she would be teaming up with Bitcoin mining service Cloudhashing.com for her new single, thus raising the prospect of more experiments in radical alternative currencies inspired or created by musicians.So which other musicians could get in on the game? Here are some potential currencies that are definitely not happening, but probably should.A System of Counting CrowsNamed after ""not-actual"" creators System of a Down and Counting Crows' Adam Duritz, this rollback of capitalism is based on the numeration of birds in the crow family â€“ including rooks, choughs and nutcrackers. It'll be much like trading cows or sheep, although personal wealth will be subject to extreme volatility, as unlike cows, crows have a tendency to fly away. Always in a straight line, apparently.Lady SovereignsModern feminism has taught us that women  must be valued. Would it be so very wrong to express that value in sovereigns â€“ an old, gold coin of the realm? Ladies of prominence like BeyoncÃ© and Ellie Goulding would be worth more of course, all the way up to the Queen â€“ the National Sovereign.  Wait a moment, is this objectifying system not the very one we use now? #satire.50 Cent CentsFairly self-explanatory. The advantage of adopting 50 CentCents as a unit of currency is that we already understand how dollars and cents work. Mind you, 50 Cent is apparently worth $260m. So a dollar in the new system would be twice that, $520m. Which means 50 Cent's net worth in the new system is actually 260 million multiplied by 520 million. According to this calculator that's 1.352e+17, a number I've never seen. So what does that make 50 Cents cents worth? Okay, maybe it's not self explanatory.NickelbacksUnder the Nickelback fiscal system, for every nickel you spend, you get a nickel back. Every transaction nullifies itself, for money is nothing but a global pantomime.Johnny CashImagine hearing: ""Your plastic's no good here. This is a Johnny Cash joint."" That's a cool phrase, right? Exactly. Alt currencies need to be popular to be viable, and there's nobody we'd rather get us out of the red than the man in black. Plus, who wouldn't give anything to have Johnny Cashback?Have you got any other suggestions? Let us know in the comments below.",908.00003,941.0,839.5,899.9999,9649.93,8553071.81,886.34

2013-12-11,Kipper Williams Christmas cards 2013,http://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2013/dec/11/kipper-williams-guardian-cartoonist-christmas-cards-2013,"Over to our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith who reports that police have just used tear gas to stop protests in the heart of the capital (see also earlier). She writes:Behind all the back-slapping festivities of todayâ€™s events there is a very different reality stalking Greece â€“ and the first rounds of tear gas fired to stop left-wing protestors gathering outside the old university buildings in central Athens to great degree symbolises the fear that reality has caused.Riot police brutally broke up the gathering, refusing to allow members of the ANTARSYA group to even hold a press conference to denounce what it described as the EUâ€™s â€œbarbaricâ€ù economic policies. One of its members, the well-known school teacher, Pavlos Antonopoulos, was dragged away in handcuffs prompting the far-left organization to vow that â€œthe governmentâ€™s violence will not stop anti-EU, anti-government protests.â€ùGreeceâ€™s main opposition Syriza party also decried the use of force saying it ran contra to the image a country should strive to have when â€œit respects the constitutionally established rights of its citizens.â€ùThroughout the day Athens has been in total lock-down with protests and gatherings prohibited from as far away as the airport to the city centre â€“ a reflection of the governmentâ€™s desire to ensure the EU commissionersâ€™ 24-hour Athenian sojourn goes smoothly when passions among the capitalâ€™s increasingly desperate populace have reached boiling point.Protesters scuffle with riot police in Athens during a protest against the Greek EU presidency. Photo: EPA/YANNIS KOLESIDISAlmost five months after Greek authorities applied similar measures when the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, also visited the capital, it is clear that official angst over each and every EU event is mounting: no dignitary can now visit Athens without draconian protection and the notion of democracy somehow being flouted. That all is not well has been highlighted by the feverishness the â€œpolitical escapeâ€ù of one of Greeceâ€™s top terrorists, the November 17 member Christos Xeros, has also stoked. In private, officials all day have been voicing embarrassment that Xeros, who was serving six life sentences, should manage to slip the authorities (while enjoying an officially condoned visit to his parents in northern Greece) at the start of the presidency. His disappearance prompted the former foreign minister Dora Bakoyannis to declare this morning that the country â€œin all likelihoodâ€ù is now headed towards a major terrorist incident. If that were not enough Kostas Simitis, the socialist former prime minister, has also raised the political thermometer by pronouncing that despite the sacrifices made by a nation now suffering record levels of poverty and unemployment, Athensâ€™ continued membership of the euro zone is still far from assured when it has a debt load that is no where near becoming sustainable. Simitis, who made the point in what insiders are calling â€œan appallingly timedâ€ù op-ed piece over the weekend, ironically oversaw Greeceâ€™s transition into the single currency. He is also the man who first foresaw that Greece would have to be rescued by the IMF. Both incidents have cast a pall over the fiesta the government will hold tonight when EU commissioners enjoy a gala evening in Athens.Â And that's where we'll leave it for tonight. Thanks for your comments and we'll be back tomorrow for the reaction to the release of the US Federal Reserve's latest minutes, as well as the meetings of the Bank of England and European Central Bank and trading updates from a host of retailers including Marks & Spencer and Tesco.",1026.00001,1056.9,856.123,920.0,23949.51,22661100.57,946.2

Indeed, we should be more grateful for it, he suggests:""The eurozone as a whole has a very small surplus .... and without the German surplus toward third countries, the eurozone would have no surplus at all, but a deficit.The American deficit won't be improved by a European one being added to it.""Ouch...Photograph: Theo Schneider/Demotix/Corbis",810.98,980.17661,787.75,918.99,27227.0,24179362.99,888.07

2013-11-25,Majority of Silk Road's Bitcoins may remain unseized,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/25/majority-of-silk-roads-bitcoins-may-remain-unseized,"Associated Press has rounded up this morning's European unemployment and retail sales data:Eurozone economy shows glimmers of hopeÂ Glimmers of hope emerged Wednesday for the eurozone economy to suggest that the coming year will see the recovery gathering steam.Official figures showed a stabilization in unemployment and the biggest increase in monthly retail sales in 12 years.Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, said the eurozone's unemployment rate held steady in November at a record 12.1 percent for the eighth month running after a modest 4,000 rise in the ranks of the jobless to 19.24 million. Since September's 12.2 percent rate was revised down, 12.1 percent is now the record.The agency also said retail sales during the month spiked by 1.4 percent, way ahead of predictions in the markets for a more modest increase of around 0.3 percent. The rise was the biggest since November 2011. Though much of the increase was due to a 2.1 percent rise in France, where consumers may have brought forward purchases ahead of a sales tax rise, analysts said the figures suggest households are increasingly confident that the financial crisis is past its worst and that the recovery has legs.The increase followed two monthly declines and was fairly broad-based across the eurozone. The Iberian economies of Spain and Portugal did particularly well, posting gains of 1.9 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.""The outlook is starting to brighten a little for eurozone consumers,"" said James Howat, European economist at Capital Economics.Despite the signs of improvement, the eurozone continues to face huge problems and most economists think it will remain the laggard of the world economy.Among the challenges will be to get unemployment down and prevent deflation, a sustained fall in prices that can encourage consumers to put off purchases in the hope of getting better bargains further down the line.Photograph: EurostatWednesday's figures highlighted disparities across the eurozone, which had 17 members in November the bloc grew to 18 members following Latvia's adoption of Europe's single currency at the start of the year.While countries like Germany and Austria have unemployment rates around 5 percent, those at the forefront of Europe's debt crisis, such as Greece and Spain, have over one in four of their people out of work.The situation among the young there is even worse, though Greece appears to be showing some improvement on that front, with 54.8 percent of those aged 15-24 out of work at last count in September, compared with 57.7 percent the previous month.Policymakers are hoping the eurozone's return to economic growth may get unemployment down. So far, the eurozone's recovery from its longest-ever though not deepest recession has been paltry but most economists are predicting a modest pick up this year, with even Greece emerging from a six-year depression that has seen its overall economic output shrink by over a fifth.Because it takes a few months for changes in economic growth to affect the labor market, and as many governments continue to make spending cuts to get public finances into shape, most economists think it will be some time before there's a real drop in unemployment.""It is good news that labor shedding has receded so that the number of unemployed is no longer rising, or at least not by much,"" said Marie Diron, a senior economist adviser at EY, formerly Ernst & Young. ""But we think that it will be a long while before we see a fall in unemployment."" AP",795.00166,850.0,758.95852,830.0,25978.29,21099945.05,812.21

The general economic backdrop remains uncertain for many families...Over at Mothercare, though, it's a darker picture as the mother and baby retailer warns that its profits will miss markets expectations (again....)Like-for-like sales at Mothercare stores (stripping out the impact of its store closure programme) have tumbledÂ 4.0% in the last 12 weeks - a crucial time for the retail sector.Â Total UK sales have slumped almost 10%.Simon Calver, Mothercare CEO, blamed ""difficult"" trading conditions in the UK:In the UK, our stores suffered similar Christmas trading pressures to those reported elsewhere.

2013-10-04,Bitcoin: what you need to know,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/04/bitcoin-what-you-need-to-know-silk-road,"As many as two million European users of Yahoo may have received PC malware from virus-laden ads served by its homepage over a four-day period last week.Some of the malware would turn PCs into bitcoin miners - a huge drain on its computing resources - without users' knowledge. Yahoo has been criticised for not saying how many people could be affected or doing anything to help those with the malware, which attacked flaws in Java modules on systems.In a statement, Yahoo said: ""From December 31 to January 3 on our European sites, we served some advertisements that did not meet our editorial guidelines â€“ specifically, they spread malware."" Users in North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America weren't affected, Yahoo said. Nor were users of Apple Macs or mobile devices.""We will continue to monitor and block any advertisements being used for this activity,"" the company added. ""We will post more information for our users shortly.""According to Light Cyber, a security research firm which warned Yahoo of the attacks in late December, one of the malware programs delivered in the attack turned the victim's computer into a bitcoin miner. The computer is set to work performing the calculations required to make the bitcoin network run, but the rewards for doing so accrue to the malware writer.Yahoo has been criticised for not doing more to aid users infected by the faulty adverts. Dan Farber of technology site CNET says that: ""At this point, Yahoo hasn't addressed any of the details, such as how the malware exploit got into its Web pages, how many users are impacted, and what victims of the attack should do. The company may still be gathering data.""Fox IT, the Dutch cybersecurity firm which first disclosed the vulnerability to the public, estimated that there were around 27,000 infections every hour the malware was live on the site. If the malware was being served consistently for the three days, it may be the case that almost 2 million computers were infected.Java target""The attack focused on outdated software,"" says Steve Regan of security site CSO. ""The only way for the exploits to work is to have outdated versions of Java on your system. If Java is up to date, then the odds are, you're safe. However, I don't trust Java, so unless you absolutely need it, my advice is to uninstall it from your system. It seems like I see more zero-day attacks aimed at Java than anything else, the risk isn't worth it for me."" Zero-day attacks exploit previously unreported flaws in software to install malware or take over a computer.As well as the bitcoin mining malware, other software installed includes ZeuS, which attempts to steal banking information; Andromeda, which turns the computer into part of a ""botnet"" for use by third parties, and ""adjacking"" malware which hijacks the user's browser to click on adverts, thus channeling income to corrupt site owners.Bitcoin is fast becoming a tool of choice for malware developers. As well as directly using compromised computers to mine for new coins, software such as ZeuS lets criminals install Cryptolocker, a dangerous new type of malware which first encrypts the user's files and then demands a ransom, payable in bitcoin, to decrypt them. In most versions of Cryptolocker, the ransom is set at two bitcoins, currently worth around $2,000.Bitcoin is so valuable to botnet owners, criminals who control large numbers of compromised computers, that one academic paper argues that the security of the network is permanently at risk. Philipp GÃ_ring and Ian Grigg argue that the currency violates Gresham's LawÂ (pdf), an economic theorem that states that bad money drives out good. Since bitcoin mining is far more profitable if done on stolen computers with stolen energy, they argue, it will soon be uneconomical to do it any other way.â€¢Â Marissa Mayer aims to revive Yahoo with shift 'from complexity to clarity'",130.97902,139.8,128.5,136.82222,17710.25,2387682.76,134.82

But after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from West's law firm, Pryor Cashman, the cryptocurrency's creators pushed forward the release, issuing the first coins last night. ""WHO GON STOP ME HUH"" they tweeted. ""Coinye feelin' the heat, gonna spread what we got so far before the bigwigs steal our work!!""Just a day before, according to the Wall Street Journal, seven of Coinye's coders received letters from West's attorney Brad D Rose. This notice accused them of trademark infringement, trademark dilution, unfair competition and cyberpiracy. ""Given Mr West's wide-ranging entrepreneurial accomplishments, consumers are likely to mistakenly believe that Mr West is the source of your services or is, as the very least ... [had] endorsed the cryptocurrency,"" Rose wrote.Kanye West - Bound 2 on MUZU.TV.	 Reading on mobile? Click here to watchWest ""seeks to resolve this matter without resort to litigation"", Rose explained. But in order to avoid a lawsuit, Coinye's inventors will have to shut the whole thing down: ending ""development, sale, distribution and promotion"" of all Coinye West products and services, deactivating their Facebook and Twitter accounts, and transferring the coinyewest.com website into West's hands.If they do not obey, Rose wrote, the rapper's lawyers will not just pursue claims against Coinye West's inventors; they will ""notify the cryptocurrency community at large of [Coinye's] infringing actions"" and sue any business that accepts the novelty currency. According to the United States' Lanham Trademark Act, West is apparently eligible for an award of treble damages, plus attorney's fees and costs.So far at least, Coinye West's intrepid techno-economists have made only one concession, changing the currency's name from Coinye West to simply Coinye. Their main website has shifted accordingly, to coinyeco.in. ""We want to release this to the public before the man can try to crush it,"" one coder told the Wall Street Journal.

Cries of ""More uncomfortable viewing than [insert name of Michael Bay film here]??!?!"" echoed around the globe. Alternatively, it might have been his notoriously firey temper that provoked the walk-out.Prepare to clench.2. Paris Hilton showed disarming precisence back in 2006 when she lent her likeness to a ""mobile phone game"". Less surprising perhaps is that she seemingly announced the wrong name at the Electronic Entertainment Expo launch event. But wait - a twist! It transpired the company, Gameloft, was at fault. Paris correctly said 'Diamond Quest' while the posters said 'Jewel Jam' because they had not been updated, but ultimately nobody cares since this was, like, a million years ago or whatever.Amazing video.3. At the Taiwanese press launch for the Sony PS Vita, pop star Rainie Yang dropped several balls in return for a fee. First, she said her favourite childhood game was Super Mario Brothers, you know, the flagship game of rival company Nintendo. Then she posed for photos holding the device upside down. Still, smiles all round.Three cheers for the Sony PiZza!4. In 2013, Youtube failed to grasp the fundamental factor in its own success by ploughing resources into a series of more mainstream, celeb-powered events. While comedy week fell a little flat, the music awards show went down with excruciatingly chaotic aplomb. Who wouldn't want to see Arcade Fire's frontman publicly embarrass himself recreating a moment when Kanye West publicly embarrassed himself?Apparently they weren't even holding a gun to the head of Win Butler's puppy.5. I'm not sure which is more shocking: that Lily Allen lost out big time (we're talking multiple millions) by turning down a live show in Second Life, the online virtual game world, for a fee paid in bitcoins - or that bitcoin has rapidly attained such economic clout that the idea of being paid in such a way now seems quite reasonable. Who knew, eh, Lily?About 5 years ago someone asked me to stream a gig live on second life for hundreds of thousNds of bitcoins, ""as if"" I said. #idiot #idiotâ€” Lily Allen  (@lilyallen) January 5, 20146. In January 2013, Blackberry appointed singer/songwriter Alicia Keys as its global creative director. A year later and the wonderfully weird partnership is no more. 'But why?' begged no one. Because Blackberry, thought everyone involved, awkwardly shuffling their feet.The first 20 seconds now play like some kind of glam tragi-comedy.7. If language were an equation, you could add 'bizarre' to 'ambitious project' and your steampunk-esque calculating apparatus might fart out 'Lady Gaga'. Perhaps Polaroid's did when it appointed the pop star as its own creative director in 2011. Together they designed a range of gadgets aimed at reinvogorating the brand, of which a decidely un-Gaga compact printer was the only one to go into production.It's not clear whether Gaga's Grey Label range included the gold mannequin.8. It comes lower down the list because it was such a notorious endors-o-fail you've probably seen it before. However, Oprah Winfrey's tweet praising Microsoft's Surface tablet, which she sent from her Apple iPad perhaps epitomises most starkly the vapidity and pitfalls of endorsing in the technological age.Would that be 12 Surface or iPad tablets, Oprah? Photograph: screengrab/Dailymail9. Last but no less of a fail-whale, we have the Megaupload endorsement video that seven major celebrities apparently did not know they would be starring in. While the companies listed above are arguably misguided rather than the archictects of their own demise, Megaupload can in no way pass this buck. They recorded ambiguously positive celebrity statements and edited them into a Youtube clip that resulted in multiple legal actions and counter actions. It all turned meta, or perhaps just tragic, when the site was shut down whole-sale for piracy in 2012.Megaupload do deserve some recognition for creating a PR disaster featuring yet in no way caused by both Kanye West and Chris Brown.",123.0,132.0,120.1,130.98925,34445.57,4386579.6,127.35
2013-10-03,Bitcoin price plummets after Silk Road closure,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/bitcoin-price-silk-road-ulbricht-value,"Bitcoin may have become a thing of fascination for the media very recently, but the digital currency actually celebrated its fifth birthday this month as its value hovered at around $1,000 per coin.Bitcoin was never intended to be the one cryptocurrency to rule them all, because anyone can make their own version of it. The code which underpins the currency is released under what's known as an open-source licence. Anyone can use it themselves, and alter any aspect they want, in order to create a whole new currency.A whole class of alternative crypto-currencies, based on the fundamental aspects of bitcoin, have been created over the past couple of years. The first and biggest of the ""altcoins"", called Litecoin, was created in 2011 to address some perceived flaws in the Bitcoin protocol.Litecoin is much harder to build specialised ""mining"" machines for, which, according to its founders, prevents it from being dominated by a few rich miners. Additionally, it clears payments faster and has a much higher cap of 84m coins.Since November 2011, Litecoin has tracked the value of Bitcoin fairly closely, but in December last year it spiked in value. Overnight, a Litecoin was worth 10 times what it had been before, and its total market cap now stands at $623m, around 16% of that of its parent.Wow, very cryptocurrencyMeasuring press attention alone, Litecoin is surely eclipsed by another altcoin with a far more compelling hook: Dogecoin.Whereas Litecoin requires an already deep understanding of cryptocurrencies to explain the ways in which it improves on Bitcoin, Dogecoin has simpler selling point: it's got a picture of a Shiba Inu dog on the front.Read with a straight face, it's a triumph of marketing. Take a field which anyone can enter, and where the average user has little or no way to distinguish between competing examples; and then whack the most popular meme of 2013, Doge, on the front of your own. (Doge, for those of you still unaware, is a meme involving pictures of a confused-looking Shiba Inu with brightly coloured comic sans text surrounding it, spelling out in idiosyncratic broken English the animal's thoughts. Wow. Very internet. Such bafflement.)Except, of course, reading it with a straight face is not the point: Dogecoin was created as a joke, to appeal to the sort of person who would find it funny. And it worked â€“ the total value of all Dogecoins in circulation is now worth almost $7m, making it the 16th most valuable alt coin in existence.If it seemed like Dogecoin was the pinnacle of the altcoin madness â€“Â coinmarketcap.com, which only tracks the ones people have actually bothered to buy and sell on exchanges, already records almost 70 â€“Â then the news from Thursday that a few coders were preparing to launch a currency based on Kanye West called, naturally, [Coinye West], proves that the idea still has legs.How to make your own vanity moneySo obviously I wanted a piece of the action. It was time to launch Herncoin.It turns out, though, that cloning bitcoin is actually harder than it looks. Although the code behind the currency is open source, it's not like the designers have just left a nice file where you can change a few lines of code to end up with a whole new currency.It actually takes some serious programming ability to get started: Dogecoin's technical co-founder, a software engineer from Portland, had to put in a couple of days of solid work to get the currency off the ground. Without a solid backing in C programming in the C language, I had no hope of creating Herncoin myself.Thankfully, Matt Corallo, a veteran bitcoin developer, came to the rescue. On Friday, he opened the doors to Coingen.io, offering to create a forked version of Bitcoin for anyone with 0.01 BTC (around $10) to spare.With Corallo's tools, the job becomes the work of minutes.Get yourself some bitcoin. You'll need 0.01 BTC to make your own altcoin, but if you're serious you'll want to splash out another 0.1 BTC to get the source code to your creation. Thoughâ€_ if you're actually serious, you probably want to hire an actual programmer to code your vanity money.Customise your coin. Coingen.io lets you pick a name and a logo, and then alter the starting paramenters of bitcoin as you see fit. If you have strong opinions over how many bitcoins should be given as a reward for mining, this is your chance to have a say. Again, though, if you have strong opinions about that sort of thing, maybe an off-the-shelf cryptocoin isn't for you.Download your vanity coin. It'll only work on Windows or Linux, sadly, but just run the finished software and away you go. I'll leave the hardest bit â€“ finding someone else to join in â€“ to you.I couldn't resist. A few seconds in an image editor to whip up a logo and Herncoin was born (you can download the program yourself):One Herncoin Photograph: /Alex HernFollowing the theme of vanity, I set the initial parameters of the coin to a series of numbers based on my name. So, for instance, the first few blocks ""mined"" will give 112,524 coins to the computer that mines them â€“ that's Alex spelled out in numbers, with 1 for A, 12 for L, and so on â€“Â and other characteristics done the same way.Once the payment had processed, I was delivered the necessary tools to run my Herncoin.Democracy and currencyIt's all silly, obviously, but there's an important point behind the proliferation of altcoins. To bitcoin advocates, they represent the democratic underpinning of the currency â€“ a democracy far fairer than the unaccountable central banks which run real-world currencies.""Bitcoin enforces majority consensus,"" says Mike Hearn, a developer of the currency. ""By taking part in the economy and running the software, or by choosing which alt coins you accept, you are effectively voting on how the currency should workâ€_ We'd like Bitcoin to be perfect, of course. If lots of people started switching to an alt coin, there'd be pressure to upgrade Bitcoin to match the alt's advantages.""We must remember that our existing currencies are controlled entirely by private banks,"" he adds. ""The central bank in most countries is not a democratic institution or even a government controlled one â€“ indeed that's the whole point of them. The Bank of England was given independence precisely because politicians knew they could not be trusted with the power to print money.""In this view of the world, the existence of Litecoin acts as a competitor to bitcoin, allowing uses to vote with their wallets in a very literal sense: if they would rather have Litecoin's benefits, they can start taking that currency, and if too many people switch, bitcoin will be forced to make concessions. It's as though, if you thought the interest rate was too low in the UK, you could start using yen instead.Herncoin doesn't offer any of such improvements. Instead, it's mostly focused around my face and my name. As a result, it seems to be having trouble taking off. I've been mining Herncoins on and off for a couple of days and, other than making my laptop really, really hot (we're talking ""if I didn't quite like this laptop I would fry an egg on it for the photo opportunity"" hot), not a huge amount has happened. Well, I've accrued a wealth of several million Herncoins, but not much else. No one else has connected to my network, which means my money may as well exist as a text file on my computer reading ""Alex Hern is really quite wealthy"".But it's an alternative of sorts. The question for bitcoin is whether the ability to make alternatives like Litecoin (and Herncoin) lessens the responsibility on those who control the currency to take a pro-active stance in managing the bitcoin economy, like that which we require of central bankers. If the Bank of England releases data showing the quantitative easing isn't working to boost the economy, we wouldn't accept Mark Carney telling us that we're free to move to France if we don't like his style.The sci-fi author Charlie Stross, in a piece titled ""Why I want Bitcoin to die in a fire"", argues that: ""Bitcoin looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind."" The economist Paul Krugman approvingly cited Stross's conclusion in his own piece headlined ""Bitcoin is evil"".For Hearn, the inability of bitcoin to respond to economic events the way managed currencies do is an unambigious positive. The bitcoin model, he says, ""is not only more democratic but more robust. Although central banks are undemocratic and unaccountable, they are nonetheless run by people who can be put under lots of pressure. We saw this in recent years with the euroâ€_ Politicians made a lot of very public noise about how Mario Draghi was personally responsible for destroying the euro, and he eventually folded.""So we currently have the worst of all worlds.""I'm not so sure. After three days of running my own currency, I'm fairly certain that a world based on Herncoin would be significantly worse.â€¢ Is Bitcoin going to change the world?",123.0,132.0,120.1,130.98925,34445.57,4386579.6,127.35

""The Central Bank does not regulate the operations of Bitcoin. The public is therefore advised to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency.""The warning mimics that of the Chinese central bank, which told financial institutions in December that the digital currency doesn't have ""real meaning"" and lacks legal protections. The Chinese warning was followed up by a ban on third-party payment processors handling payments for bitcoin exchanges, a move which in effect ended legal purchases of bitcoin in the country.Colbert Lau, the founder of Bitcoin Malaysia, which promotes the currency domestically, said that he was not concerned by the bank's statement.""It's similar to the stance taken by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) [Singapore's central bank] earlier.Â While The Bank of Thailand had an outright ban, our Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) did not outlaw its use or say bitcoin was illegal.""We foresee big players from USA and Europe moving rapidly to Asia in the next few months and setting up local branches.""â€¢ Missing: hard drive containing bitcoin worth Â£4m in Newport landfill site",123.0,132.0,120.1,130.98925,34445.57,4386579.6,127.35

That in itself may not be a bad thing but investment flight has deep effects on ""ecosystem"" participants.Venture investments tend to feed entrants disproportionately and they are remarkably sensitive to the valuations of public companies (and IPOs).

2013-10-02,"Boot up: Windows creep, Samsung's benchmark, Guardian Reddits, and more",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/oct/02/samsung-benchmark-makerbot-windows,"Writing in Quartz, an admirable sister publicationÂ of the Atlantic magazine, the other day, the experienced technology watcher Christopher Mims struck a gloomy note. Under the headline ""2013 was a lost year for tech"", he lamented that ""all in, 2013 was an embarrassment for the entire tech industry and the engine that powers it â€“ Silicon Valley. Innovation was replaced by financial engineering, mergers and acquisitions,Â and evasion of regulations. Not a singleÂ breakthrough product was unveiled.""Warming to his gloomy theme, Mims argued that: innovations in smartphones had stalled (""2013 was the year smartphones became commodities, just like the PCs they supplanted""); ""smartwatches were easily the biggest letdown of the year"";Â ""former giants"" [ie Microsoft, Intel and Blackberry] had continued their ""inglorious decline""; ""mergers and acquisitions had replaced innovation""; social media became ""profitable if not compelling""; mainstream media's appetite for sensational stories made them vulnerable to ""techno-hype"" about stuff such as Bitcoin; and of course theÂ NSA revelations cast a chilly spell over all things technological.As an end-of-year retrospective piece, Mims's essay was perfectly workmanlike. After all, a glass can be half empty or half full, depending on what point of view one wishes to uphold. But it had a predictably annoying impact on people in Silicon Valley, who tend to think of Palo Alto as the centre of the known universe. One complainant was Om Malik, who is at least as experienced a tech watcher as Mims. ""Dear Quartz,"" he wrote, ""maybe it's Quartz that needs new glasses and a map. 2013 was not a lost year for tech.""The essence of Malik's argument is that it all depends what you mean by ""technology"". If you mean the flashy, consumer product stuff, then Mims's dismissive view of 2013 may indeed be valid (though Malik disagrees with him about the iPhone 5s, citing its M7 chip as a development with major disruptive capabilities). But if you think of ""technology"" as the deep structure that eventually enables all kinds of disruptive developments, then it's meaningless to talk about stops and starts in innovation because the really big stuff is also on a slow burn. Even in a fast-moving industry such as computing, it can sometimes take 25 years before a major technological breakthrough starts to show results in terms of products, services and major industrial disruption.As an example, Malik cites Amazon's launch of Amazon Web Services (its cloud computing operation) in 2006. Back then, he writes, ""there weren't very many of us who had an idea that it would one day become the key component of an economic engine that would jump-start entrepreneurial activity across the planet. No one thought that [cloud computing] was sexy. Today, if you ask Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, he will have a few billion reasons to think of AWS as the greatest thing since sliced bread. Yeah, that joke of a service will soon be a multibillion dollar business that has put everyone from Oracle, Dell and HP on thin ice.""I'm with Malik on this. Cloud computing is a good illustration of why much media commentary about â€“ and public perceptions of â€“ information technology tends to miss the point. By focusing on tangible things â€“ smartphones, tablets, Google Glass, embedded sensors, wearable devices, social networking services, and so on â€“ it portrays technology as gadgetry, much as earlier generations misrepresented (and misunderstood) the significance of solid state electronics by calling portable radios ""transistors"".What matters, in other words, is not the gadget but the underlying technology that makes it possible.  Cloud computing is what turns the tablet and the smartphone into viable devices. And underpinning cloud computing and most of the shiny stuff we take for granted â€“ from the web to Skype to Facebook to the iTunes Store to eBay to Amazon to Google â€“ is the good ol' internet, which was created in the 1960s and 70s with public money and no expectation of profit. Without the net, none of what we take for granted today would have been possible. And yet when the net first appeared, almost nobody understood its significance â€“ and one of Mr Mims's predecessors might haveÂ been complaining in December 1983 (11 months after the network had been switched on for public use) that itÂ had been ""a lost year for tech"".

2013-09-19,Cullen Hoback: 'Edward Snowden completely shifted the dialogue',http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/19/cullen-hoback-edward-snowden,"This is the year that cities become even smarter. Local authorities and councils the world over have invested in social capital and connected infrastructure with the aim of better understanding the needs of their citizens.The Watershed arts venue in Bristol, for example, organised a Playable City Award in 2013, whose aim was ""to commission an original, future-facing work, that used creative technology to explore the theme of the playable city."" London, meanwhile, has introduced bins that send text messages when they are nearly full and has used sensors installed under parking bays in the West End to relieve congestion in the area â€“ and the city is manually moving Boris Bikes to bays people are cycling from but not cycling towards (generally, if it's at the top of a hill).In 2014, more cities will iterate and experiment. They'll implement new technologies to not only create a better connected city but to enhance the environment. That could include street lights switching on due to residents complaining about the lack of light on Twitter. There's a great number of opportunities available â€“ and that's an exciting prospect. - Siraj DatooGamesDestiny from Bungie, creators of Halo, is set to make 2014 a year to remember.Although the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launch games were largely disappointing, 2014 will certainly see both machines move up a gear. The twin giants of the release schedule will be the epic space opera Destiny from Bungie Software, and Titanfall, the new sci-fi shooter from Respawn Entertainment. This is basically the makers of Halo versus the creators of Call of Duty in one galactic face-off. There will be robot limbs and crashed space ships everywhere.And the carnage won't end there. 2014 is a year of gigantic action blockbusters. Ubisoft has its cyberpunk romp Watch Dogs, as well as the ingenious online multiplayer strategy shooter, The Division. The PS4 has intriguing steampunk adventure The Order: 1886, while Xbox One has the new post-apocalyptic thriller, Quantum Break, which ties in with and interacts with a TV series of the same name. We can expect more of this media crossover ""excitement"" as the barriers between games consoles and set-top boxes crumble.More intriguing perhaps is the rise of persistent online worlds and emergent simulations. We're getting three very interesting space exploration titles in the form of Star Citizen (from the creator of the legendary Wing Commander series), No Man's Sky from tiny UK studio Hello Games and Starbound, from another British developer, Chucklefish â€“ the latter two promising vast procedurally generated galaxies.Â But closer to home, this will also be a year of ideas. From Chris Hecker's fascinating asymmetrical two-player body language game Spy Party, to Jonathan Blow's Myst-like adventure The Witness, to the storybook mythology of Tengami and the heartbreaking adventure title That Dragon Cancer, 2014 will mess with our heads and expectations of what games are. And if you don't want to be messed with, that's fine â€“ there are sequels, so many sequels. Hotline Miami 2, Dark Souls II, Metal Gear Solid V and the hugely promising Elder Scrolls Online. 2014 will take a brave look at the future of gaming technology, but it will bring the past along for the ride. -Â Keith StuartPatentsNokia holds many key patents, and is not afraid to use them.Sick of hearing about patent lawsuits between big-name tech companies? Bad luck â€“ 2014 is going to bring more of them, after a relative lull in 2013. The part of Nokia that isn't being sold to Microsoft is sharpening its patent portfolio, and has begun exercising it successfully against HTC. Next in line is Google (particularly Google Maps) and other Android handset makers.Apple and Samsung will also be back in a Californian court in March, in a second trial in which each is asserting five patents â€“ in Apple's case, all relating to function, not ""how it looks"". Samsung's list includes two standards-essential patents (SEPs) â€“ which it's obliged to license, so it's hard to see it prevailing on those.Besides those, Rockstar, a company which owns a $4.5bn haul of patents from now-dead Canadian network company Nortel (and is in turn owned by Apple, Microsoft, Ericsson, Sony and BlackBerry), has filed patent infringement cases against Google, Samsung, HTC, Asus, LG, Pantech, Huawei and ZTE â€“ all Android device makers. In a countersuit, Google says that Rockstar's lawsuit is put ""a cloud on Google's Android platform; threatened Google's business and relationships with its customers and partners, as well as its sales of Nexus-branded devices"".All to play for in that one â€“ and Rockstar has a cherry on top, which is a separate case against Google where it claims the search company infringes a search patent filed in 1997, before Google even existed. -Â Charles ArthurEmerging market smartphonesThe Chinese market for smartphones has been expanding like a balloon, and it's continuing. Expect 230m handsets to be sold there in 2014, almost all of them ""AOSP"" Android (not running Google services).Â India too is growing fast â€“ millions of people there will be getting their first smartphone in 2014, and that could change the complexion not only of the mobile market, but also the country itself. One of the strongest phone brands in India? Nokia. Is this going to be Microsoft's chance?And South America is being targeted by handset makers interested in getting Firefox OS into peoples' hands. There's everything to play for as huge numbers of people get their first internet connection.Â - Charles ArthurWearablesFitness trackers or personal nag machines?With luck, 2014 will be the year that wearables actually become wearable â€“ rather than being nagging devices that hassle you to take more steps to meet your ""daily exercise quota"". The key problem is crossing the gulf between being ""something you wear"", and ""something you want to be seen wearing"".Â Google Glass still has dorkiness problems, for all its evident usefulness. All eyes are on Apple to do something there, but it can be the smaller companies that surprise. -Â Charles ArthurPCs and tabletsThe Microsoft Surface Pro 2 was a full Windows 8.1 computer squeezed into a tablet formfactor and weighed the same as a laptop.The market for PCs (desktops and fixed-keyboard notebooks) will be flat, at best, but Microsoft â€“ and computer makers â€“ have a lot staked on ""convertibles"" with detachable keyboards, and touchscreen laptops.However, there's no sign that people are interested in them. We like our PCs in traditional packages, and all of Microsoft's efforts with the Surface haven't persuaded people that they need one; it's a weight thing. Thinner and lighter always wins on mobile, and even the new generation of Surface isn't thin and light enough to beat other tablets. (And success then comes down to how many apps they can run.)Rumours of a larger Apple tablet - up to 12in? - could mean that the iPad is ready to mature and expand into newer segments. Tablet sales are still rocketing, and even if many are being used as TV replacements (certainly the case in Asia), it's still an opportunity for app developers to get in front of users. -Â Charles ArthurCheaper, ever cheaperTesco's Hudl tablet cost just Â£119 and flew off the shelves.The budget tablet market exploded in 2013, filling the void left largely untouched by Apple, Google and other big-brand manufacturers such as Sony and Samsung. Lower specified, but cheaper-priced Android tablets costing in the Â£100 rangeÂ flew off the shelves, especially in the run-up to Christmas.Surprise entries from Aldi, Argos and Tesco made headlines, with the latter'sÂ Hudl tablet showingÂ that devices around Â£100 could perform well enough for the average consumer and inspire impulse buys.This year is likely to see that downward pressure on price continue, with more and more affordable tablet computers available as more people who wouldn't have considered buying a computer let alone a tablet at prices well over Â£100 purchase them.Tesco has already confirmed that it is working onÂ an updated Hudl tablet for release in 2014, while other British high street brands are likely to follow suit. We've already seen tablets go on saleÂ for as little as Â£30, so could 2014 be the year that tablets fell out of cereal packets?Buyer beware, however, as you get what you pay for with these ultra-low cost tablets â€“ and for tablets such as the terrible Argos MyTablet, your money is better saved and spent elsewhere.Â â€“ Samuel GibbsThe boring matters matterAmazon is working on a Prime Air drone delivery system that could deliver packages in 30 minutes or less, but regulatory challenges stand in its way. Photograph: ZUMA/REXSilicon Valley's attitude has always been to ask forgiveness rather than permission. Sometimes, the law catches up with the companies that push their luck, and they are forced to close or comply â€“ although, all too often, the damage has been done. Napster may have been shut down, but our relationship with paying for music has never quite recovered. Other times, the law is forced to change to accommodate the shifts that technology has made possible. That's why you can now use your Kindle on a plane during take-off and landing.But in recent years, the gap between the cutting edge of technology and the cutting edge of regulation has been getting smaller and smaller, and 2014 could be the first year in which the roles are reversed. For 3D printing, wearable computing and personal drones, legislators are already gearing up to tackle whether â€“ and how â€“ the law should react.These technologies haven't yet hit the mainstream, but they have already sparked consternation in the public. 3D-printed guns have already sparked legislation in congress, West Virginia is set to become the first state to ban using Google Glass in a car, and the FAA is committed to reviewing the rules that currently ban companies such as Amazon from using drones to deliver goods. But the biggest fight hasn't even warmed up: that will be the battle around self-driving cars. If you thought it was hard to convince regulators to let you use electronic devices on planes, try to find a regulator who will be happy to have a driver asleep at the wheel. â€“Â Alex HernTruly smart technologiesGoogle Glass could be the future, if it can get over its image and imaging problems. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesWe'll see the app store for Google Glass open early this year, and so will finally start to see what wearable, immersive technology will be capable of once developers start to explore the device fully to a wider audience. Expect to see Google working hard to make consumers feel more comfortable with the concept of pervasive image and video recording, challenging and shifting the norm of what is socially acceptable.Also expect to see Google continue to try to refocus its core search business around social, and with more disquiet from marketers, publishers and businesses as they realise they are being pushed into using Google+.The education space will become increasingly interesting, with everything from the newly invigorated computer science curriculum in UK schools, to the spread of open online learning courses; it will be interesting to see how many of the prestige UK universities choose to exploit their status and reputation by publishing some free courses as a marketing tool.Tech entrepreneurs will keep expanding into increasingly diverse niches, so it will be amusing to try and pick out the most obscure market being disrupted in 2014.As for a few new year wishes, I'd like to see some meat on the bones of the 3D printing movement to take it beyond novelty into something useful, practical and relevant for most civilians. I'd also like to see some big steps in services that aggregate all, or a lot, of our data for us, and automate the administration of living, whether that's bills or dentist appointments. Whatever the answer is, it needs to cut out the tedium of filling in boxes with details that machines should be able to do for us. Google Now, but more so. And as ever, could somebody please, please make email better?Â - Jemima KissBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies""Bitcoin accepted here"", reads a sign at the entrance to a bar in Berlin-Kreuzberg, Germany. Photograph: AlamyI'm wary about making predictions about bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general. The first time I wrote about them, in March of 2013, I said that the value of bitcoin looked like a bubble. If, instead of writing the piece, I'd went out and bought Â£100 of them, I'd currently be sitting on bitcoins worth a little under Â£2000. The Alex Hern Regrets Index is near an all-time high.But I do, fundamentally, stand by what I wrote back then. The price of a bitcoin looks ever more out of proportion with the number of people using it, and that's a state of affairs that cannot continue. This time last year, the cost of one bitcoin was $13; it is now hovering around $800. And yet, this time last year there were 39,000 bitcoin transactions per day, a number which has barely moved at all, currently standing at 41,000. People are paying ever more heady sums of money for a currency they are steadfastly not using.But the dying days of 2013 provided a hint as to how this trend will continue into the New Year, with the explosion in value of the ""altcoins"".Because bitcoin is an open-source software project, the programming code at the heart of it is available for anyone to take and use in making their own cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins. The first and biggest of these, Litecoin, was created in October 2011, and exploded in value in November 2013, its price shooting up tenfold in a matter of days.The next month saw the creation of Dogecoin, an altcoin that had one killer USP: a picture of an adorable Shiba Inu on the front and a website written in multicoloured comic sans and faux broken English. Look, it's the internet; don't try to understand.But the association with the popular Doge meme alone was enough to give Dogecoin the cachet required for its own boom and bust. At its peak, around Christmas, when 30m Dogecoins were stolen in a hacking attack on a Dogecoin bank (another new commonplace of cryptocurrencies), the haul was worth around $18,000.So, my prediction for 2014? An extrapolation: the smart money, getting bored of Bitcoin, will start moving on to the various altcoins, chasing the massive profits they can no longer get from bitcoin proper. They'll see their own bubbles of hype and investment, with diminishing returns each time. And by the end of next year, there will still only be a few people actually using bitcoin as a payment mechanism for anything other than illegal and fringe-legal purposes. â€“Â Alex HernMicrosoft, Apple, and GoogleMicrosoft, Apple and Google all rely on huge amounts of server power for their globe-spanning services. Photograph: Connie Zhou/APMicrosoft is going to go through big changes in 2014: the arrival of only its third chief executive, replacing Steve Ballmer, comes as its revenue streams and business models are under growing attack. Mobile computing is becoming a tsunami, eroding the traditional reliance on the desktop and Office. As Microsoft pivots into being a ""devices and services"" company (which will also own its own handset company, bought from Nokia), it will be competing on every front with Apple and Google.Â Prediction: there will be high-profile departures and murmurings of dissent as the new chief executive digs in. Consumers will continue to ignore Windows 8. The coming death of Windows XP (in corporate terms) in April will prompt first-quarter commercial PC sales, but see a lull afterwards. Windows Phone will make gains at the low end, but be unable to dislodge Android or iOS at the high end.Apple is on its third chief executive if you only include Steve Jobs and John Sculley (and ignore the revolving doors of the mid-90s). Tim Cook's genius at operations shows in how Apple is now making scores of different versions of the iPhone for different markets, yet everyone thinks there's only one (the iPhone for the new China Mobile 4G system, for example, differs from all others sold worldwide).Â Every new year sees a raft of wild predictions about the unicorns Apple must release or be condemned to obscurity, at least in commentators' eyes. Every year Apple predictably doesn't do them. So what will it do?Prediction: it won't release a TV â€“ the same TV it hasn't released for years. It might update the Apple TV set-top box to do more (add an App Store?), but that's been a ""safely wrong"" prediction for years too.Â It will probably release a wearable something-or-other; a watch seems most likely. Filing for ""iWatch"" trademarks, as it has in Europe and Japan, is a good sign that something's afoot. Shouldn't there be leaks from the supply chain by now, though?A bigger iPad Air â€“ iPad Pro? â€“ looks likely. A touch-based Macbook Air, though, doesn't.Google is only on its second chief executive (and even he was the original one). It's still a relatively young company, but its rapid growth has seen Larry Page reining in some projects that haven't been core to what Google does â€“ collect information and collate it. Google+ is core; Google Reader wasn't. And selling adverts is the ultimate core. Quite where Google Glass fits into this isn't yet clear; nor is Motorola, which loses huge amounts of money while selling fewer handsets each quarter.There are also lingering antitrust hassles: besides Europe, where the questions about Google's integration of its vertical search such as shopping and maps into its front page have gone on for three years, Canada has now begun asking exactly the same questions. It's a big inconvenience for Google â€“ though the bigger headache might be the patent lawsuits referred to above.Prediction: Google Glass will go on limited sale, and have limited success; its best use is in narrow commercial applications. Android will continue eating the mobile world, and getting into embedded systems, though frequently without Google services embedded. - Charles ArthurThis article was amended to reflect the fact that the Playable City Award was organised by the Watershed arts venue in Bristol.",140.41234,141.2,131.14,135.05037,19769.45,2695293.89,136.34
2013-09-09,"Jake Davis, aka LulzSec's 'Topiary', on how the group formed - and broke up",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/09/jake-davis-topiary-lulzsec-answers,"The house across the street has just gone on sale for Â£850,000. A bog-standard, late-Victorian, ex-council terrace house in the rough part of Islington, with a yard billed as a garden, costs as much as a street in Middlesbrough or Stoke.When Marx wrote, in his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, that money ""is the visible divinity"" involving ""the transformation of all human and natural properties into their contraries, the universal overturning and confounding of things: it makes brothers of impossibilities"", he wasn't predicting how the north London property market would heat up in 2013, but he was unwittingly prescient. What has happened to our moral and social values? Could they be more detached from monetary values? Or, hideously, are they accurately expressed by what money can buy?Our task in 2014 is to stop this madness, get a grip on money, put a chokehold on Marx's visible divinity and make it do our bidding rather than what it's been doing for the past year: confounding, diminishing and degrading us. It'll be an unequal struggle: in this contest with the divine, we'll be like Jacob wrestling the angel.But the imperative to resist our corruption by money has never been stronger. If our values are expressed by what money can buy, those values have gone nuts. In Harrods' new Fragrance Room you can buy a 7kg, faux-zebra-skin-wrapped candle scented in patchouli, cinnamon and candied lemon, ""with spicy and woody notes which are subtly savage and masculine"". Can candles smell savage and masculine, you ask? Probably not, but that's not the point. Aren't fur wrappings for candles a fire hazard? Probably, but again, not the point. Guess how much it costs: Â£599. Just the thing for all those blackouts that'll happen if Ed Miliband ever gets elected and fails to nationalise gas and electricity suppliers (as he should lickety split). At the other end of the scale, I was scandalised this summer that I couldn't find a Poundland or a 99p shop in Tenby. They'd been replaced by Â£1.20 shops â€“ all the better to seasonally exploit, or so I theorised, tourist muppets like me.Back to the property market. Who can afford Â£850k? Not the few council tenants who remain in this asset-stripped, right-to-buy-ravaged street. Certainly not those subsisting in increasing numbers on food banks, those who can't heat their homes or buy food because their budgets have been clobbered by the bedroom tax. Not even the hypocritical, owner-occupying locusts (including me) that swooped in during the aftermath of Thatcher's deracinating, spirit-crushing, community-wrecking property liberalisation.Of all the piquant stories dramatising how in 2013 we have lost sense of our values, how money has not just corrupted us, but got away from our comprehension (think: the Saatchi household's unread five-figure credit card bills, the Co-op chief underestimating his bank's assets by tens of billions, the real world tragicomedies of the Bitcoin revolution), none has seemed more personally relevant to me than this. This is a country of houses that scarcely anyone can afford. We have become degraded bit-part players in a street theatre of cruelty in which we are daily diminished by the prices of things we can't afford.Many of us are unwitting monsters of conspicuous consumption, walking around with Â£500 iPhones or Â£270 Beats by Dre headphones, often through areas where consumer durables like those are not so much must-haves but never-will-haves. When a poor kid stole my iPhone in the street earlier this year, part of me got the theft equivalent of Stockholm syndrome â€“ I felt that I deserved it. Which, as he told me during a restorative justice session months after his conviction for theft and robbery, I didn't.As if to clinch this point about cruelly monetised street theatre, a two-bedroom house recently went on sale in London's West Hampstead for Â£300,000, billed as the cheapest freehold house in central London. Around 90 prospective buyers jammed into its little rooms, a queue formed outside and estate agents acted as bouncers â€“ evicting prospective purchasers as if from an exclusive club. Which is what the property-owning class is. ""The level of desperation is still there as the severe housing shortage in the city hasn't yet been solved,"" Lois Fort, head of residential lettings at Dutch & Dutch said.We live in a country where you can run, but only pointlessly dream of catching up, where the majority of the poor (according to the latest government statistics) aren't the kind of people whom Iain Duncan Smith wants to terminate for the public good, but in work.I say ""we"". Let's not get too pious about what the confusion of money has done to British society. We're not all in this together, despite what David Cameron says (""Never,"" as Arcade Fire sang, ""trust a millionaire quoting the Sermon on the Mount""; never, they could have added, trust an Etonian plutocrat expressing solidarity with Cardboard City). Oh baby, I thought, as I clicked through the online photo gallery of the house for sale opposite â€“ it's Â£300k more expensive than the last house to sell in this street! Our house may be worth as much! If not more! We're rich beyond our wildest dreams! By doing nothing! Or maybe not. Let's not go crazy: it hasn't sold yet.Money has always been thus â€“ whimsically making and unmaking fortunes, chucking out largesse irrespective of merit or desert and producing laughably misplaced expectations. Only now it seems more perverse, less graspable, wilder in its dispensations than ever.Oscar Wilde once said: ""Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing."" Today we continue to know the value of nothing, but we don't know the price of anything either. We've got used to government ministers not knowing the price of a pint of milk, of David Cameron batting away inquisitorial probing about the price of a loaf by replying he prefers to bake his own in a bread maker, thanks very much.Now we're getting used to more spectacular examples of monetary ignorance. When Paul Flowers, the disgraced chief executive of Co-op, appeared before the Commons treasury select committee and estimated the value of my bank's assets at Â£3bn (not far off, Reverend Flowers: the actual figure is Â£47bn), I wasn't sure how to feel or what to do. Was his evident grasp of the street value of ketamine, crystal meth and coke consoling in these circumstances for his customers or, you know, not? Should I transfer my overdraft and joke pension to First Direct (whatever that is) or convert it into Bitcoin currency (ditto), squirrel it away into offshore funds (whatever that means) or just hang tough (ditto)?I did nothing, but felt heartened by Flowers' on-trend confusion â€“ he was a kindred spirit, one confounded by money. Just a shame that his job description implied a competence at managing it. Mine doesn't, which is just as well. Whenever I'm asked the great imponderables â€“ how many texts on your phone package, how did the Higgs Boson particle confer mass on the early universe, what's for tea â€“ it's always the financial ones that drive me to make wild stabs in the dark like Flowers. How much does my mobile phone cost a month? Five pounds. Maybe Â£85. One or the other. I haven't got a grip on the stuff that's haemorraging from my current account. All I do know is that life is too short to spend time on comparison sites working out which of E.ON or npower proposes to rip me off less. The free market lie-dream of making capitalism work by developing informed choices about things (phone tariffs, gas bills, primary schools, hospitals, and â€“ please God no â€“ cars) that differ only fractionally isn't what I was put on this Earth for, whatever the government and Martin Lewis of moneysavingexpert.com say.And I'm not alone in this. Many of us have become small-time Charles Saatchis. Among the many unpalatable things the millionaire art collector told Isleworth Crown Court during the trial of his and ex-wife Nigella Lawson's two assistants was that he didn't check his credit card bills. Like many of us, he values the time spent sitting in his pants eating beans from a tin pining for his departed domestic goddess much more than the nightmare of putting his finances in order. The only difference between him and us is that it doesn't matter if Â£76,000 a month is floating unnoticed out of his purview, while we get kneecapped by hired thugs if we don't repay payday loan companies the 50 quid we've borrowed on time (in so far as I understand their business models).Spending has never been so easy, or so perilous. 2013 was the year that the bank issued me with a wave-and-go card. You hold it near a card reader, wave it like the Queen acknowledging her subjects from a limo, and suddenly you own seven flat whites you don't remember ordering and you're on a list somewhere saying you're no longer creditworthy. That's why, no doubt, there's a Â£20 limit on such contactless purchases â€“ otherwise, I'd bring the banking system to collapse for a second time.But, if you believe such Panglossian penseurs as Niall Ferguson, such financial innovations as contactless cards, PayPal, virtual currencies and replacing workers with self-scanning machines are handmaidens to human progress. ""Far from being the work of mere leeches intent on sucking the life's blood out of indebted families or gambling with the savings of widows and orphans, financial innovation has been an indispensable factor in man's advance from wretched subsistence to the giddy heights of material prosperity that so many people know today,"" argued Ferguson in The Ascent of Money.And the pub in east London where you can buy beer with the virtual currency Bitcoin, that is â€“ somehow â€“ part of that ascent of money? It is, argue enthusiasts, money by and for the people, a currency that arrived in 2009 at a time when trust in bankers was, as we all know, not buoyant. And it is possible to make real-money fortunes from Bitcoin that can be expressed in bricks and mortar. For example, four years ago Kristoffer Koch bought Â£22 worth of the virtual currency, which is usually used for online transactions. Such is Bitcoin's volatility that his investment, which he had forgotten about until reading reports of its rise in value last year, was worth $850,000. He cashed a fifth of that fortune in order to buy an apartment in one of Oslo's wealthier districts.I know what you're thinking. ""Oslo? Sheez. No way I'm living in Oslo when I've made my fortune from speculation in a currency I don't even understand. Have you seen how much a beer costs there?"" But that's not really the point. The point is that Bitcoin is a virtual currency sustained by a Ponzi-like belief that it is not worthless, and unbacked by the banking sector, gold or any of the established underpinnings of monetary value. For those of us whose first experience of money was using halfpennies and threepenny bits to buy gobstoppers and pea-shooters (stop looking blank, younger readers), such a mutation is hard to understand â€“ unless, that is, we accept the truth of what a banker explained to me this week, namely banking is, has always been and always will be a confidence trick.James Howells was less fortunate than his Norwegian counterpart. Last summer the British IT worker chucked out his computer hard drive. Only one problem: it turned out that it contained the cryptographic key he needed to access a digital wallet containing 7,500 Bitcoins which, he realised probably with a tremble in his otherwise stiff upper lip, was worth Â£4m. He hadn't backed up his hard drive (we've all been there, right?). His story is the 2013 version of a bank robber's millions blown across fields from a moving train with the twist that nobody, not even children otherwise unoccupied during the school holidays, is going to find Howells' fortune. That said, virtual fortune hunters are reportedly rummaging through the landfill site where it ended up. They, like Captain Oates only more so, may be some time.If our task in 2014 is to get a grip on money, here's one little attempt. The other day I went to the shop with a notepad and a daughter. My eight-year-old's homework task was to note down the prices of things and put them in order. As often happens when assisting with primary-school homework, I learned more than she did. I thought it was she who was living in a disadvantaged monetary fairyland where, because of the advent of the cashless society (across Europe now only 9% of transactions take place in cash; in the US it's 7%, according to Daniel Conaghan and Dan Smith's The Book of Money), she would struggle to know how much basic things cost since, unlike me, she had never had to count out the price of them in coins of the realm.But it turns out that I am the greater financial ignoramus. Did you know that a pint of semi-skimmed milk is 49p? That you can buy a banana for 19p? How much the Saturday Guardian costs? Me neither. In an increasingly cashless society where we punch out our pin for sums that scarcely figure in our consciousness, it's easy to spend money without realising it.Money has become for us what beer was for Homer Simpson â€“ the cause of and solution to all of our problems. Can we make it just the solution? It seems unlikely.More from 2014: a look aheadZoe Williams, politics: The prospect of the 2015 general election will reveal our parties' true coloursBarney Ronay, sport: Brazil's horribly invasive footballing traumaImogen Fox, fashion: Minimalism is dead â€“ long live maximalismSimon Tisdall, global feuds: Nobody is talking about a third world war between China and the west - yetSophie Heawood, celebrity: It's not enough to be a brand.

2013-09-05,Bitcoin dealers seek official regulation for digital tokens,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/05/bitcoin-dealers-regulation-downing-street,"From forcefields to gene testing, some of the technology that came to the surface in 2013 sounds like the future we've all been waiting for. Uber, Waze and Whatsapp are new companies doing things with tech that disrupts the old guard. But Tor reminds us that not everyone has access to the same internet that we all rely on day in and day out.TorTor â€“ formerly known as The Onion Router â€“ is the most popular of the many anonymising services that exist online. A user's traffic is bounced around multiple nodes of a peer-to-peer network until it comes out the other side, untraceable and anonymous. It hit the news due to sites such as Silk Road requiring their customers to use Tor, a fact which worries the various activists, opposition groups and privacy advocates for whom anonymous browsing isn't a luxury but a necessity.Â â€¢ A beginner's guide to TorTribal headphonesOnce upon a time, just wearing white earbuds was enough to mark you out as a mugging target: the cachet of an iPod in the early 2000s was nearly limitless. But over time, Apple's products proliferated, and competitors copied the style until, by 2013, the least cool thing possible was to still be using the stock headphones which came with your smartphone. Instead, this year saw the rise of tribal headphones: whether you wear Skullcandy, Beats by Dr. Dre or Urbanears marks you out as a member of a particular scene in just the same way that clothes, piercings and hairstyles have done for years.â€¢ Twenty years ago the most important thing for a teenager was their trainers. Now it's the brand covering their ears that mattersTwitter goes publicâ€_After Facebook went public last year, the world anticipated Twitterâ€™s IPO announcement. Unlike Facebook, which saw computer glitches in NASDAQâ€™s system delay trading by half an hour, Twitter chose to list their stock on the New York Stock Exchange, bringing an end to NASDAQâ€™s monopoly on internet-focussed companies. Twitter stock launched at $26 per share in November and each share is now valued at over $53 (as of 17 December).Â â€¢ In the process of going public, Twitter had to reveal how their business works in more detail than ever beforeâ€_ and gets seriousWhile 2013 was a good year to be in possession of some Twitter stock, it was also the first year the social network had to face up to the responsibilities that come from hosting communication between 220 million users. In August, the site had to deal with a number of high-profile users receiving rape and bomb threats from misogynist attackers, and it was forced to update its rulesÂ to more easily ban the offenders. Then, in December, it all kicked off again.Â â€¢ Anonymous-related Twitter accounts suspended after misogynist abuseUberSan Francisco-based startup Uber may currently look like a slightly more switched-on version of your local minicab firm, but the company has aims that go much higher. The same software it uses to ensure that users can get a car whenever they want, wherever they are, will also â€“ it hopes â€“ work to route couriers, school buses and more. Just as Amazon wants to be the Everything Store, Uber hopes to become the Everything Mover. But first it's got to solve the PR problem caused by its ""surge pricing"" policy, increasing the price of a taxi by up to eight times in busy periods, and with the fact that in some markets, it's faced trouble with the law.â€¢ Sharing economy drives into trouble with ride-sharing arrestsUltrasonic/haptic feedbackResearchers from Bristol showed that the feel of real objects could be simulated in mid-air using nothing by sound waves, potentially revolutionising the feedback provided by any number of touchscreen or gesture-based interfaces.Â â€¢ ""Forcefield"" technology could let us control computers Minority Report styleVineBefore Instagram video was launched, Twitter unveiled Vine â€“ six-second video clips that play in a loop and are quick and easy to upload and share. While not an instant hit, the app soon found a devoted following, and over the last year some fantastic work has been done on the platform.â€¢ In the future, everyone can be famous for six secondsWaterproof phonesWaterproof technology is the future â€“ especially if you ask Sony, whoâ€™ve kitted out their flagship smartphone and smartwatch with waterproof shells. Weâ€™re probably not going to forget the poor souls who got tricked into thinking their iPhones became waterproof once they updated to iOS7.â€¢ 'Waterproof iPhone' ad hoax tricked users into destroying their handsetsWazeThis Israeli startup was one of the hottest acquisitions of the year, with Apple and Google reportedly battling to acquire its technology, which uses crowdsourced traffic data to provide drivers with up-to-the-minute congestion information. In the end, Google won out â€“ at aÂ cost of $1.3bn.Â â€¢ In the end, even Waze didn't help Google win the maps warsWhat does the Fox say?Billed as ""2013's Gangnam Style"" from the off, this viral video from Norwegian duo Ylvis never quite made it to the heights of Psy's megahit. It tried just a bit too hard, and wasn't catchy enough. But it was fun while it lasted.â€¢Â WhatÂ does the Fox say?WhatsappWhatsapp would have been unimaginable in the pre-iPhone days. Its sole purpose is to let users use their all-you-can-eat data contracts to send and receive texts and picture messages for free. It is, in short, everything the mobile phone carriers feared could happen if data became pervasive. And with 250 million users worldwide, it's starting to scare more than just the titans of text messaging. Both Twitter and Facebook have strengthened their own messaging services in an attempt to stave off the up-and-comer.As texting turns 20, could Whatsapp take the place of SMS?WinkleviiTwin Olympic rowers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss once sued Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing the idea for Facebook from them, but they had a new shot at fame in 2013. On 11 April, they announced they had acquired a hoard of bitcoins then worth $11m â€“ representing a substantial share of the nascent currency's total value at the time. As it happened, their announcement came almost exactly as the bubble burst, instantly wiping out much of their investment. But they held on, and by the end of the year, their share was worth well north of $100m.Â â€¢ The Winklevoss twins, and why you need to careXbox OneMicrosoft's newest console has got off to a rocky start. Even before it was launched it suffered an extraordinary self-inflicted PR blow when Microsoft announced that the console wouldn't play pre-owned games, nor allow users to lend discs to friends and family. The company quickly revised that, and its actual launch has been somewhat smoother, selling 307,000 consoles in the week leading up to Christmas. With supply constraints kicking in, we won't know for sure if the bad publicity hurt the console until well into 2014.â€¢ Review:Â lots of potential - but ultimately a PS4 underdog23andMePersonal genome testing was supposed to be the big thing of 2013, but reality got in the way. 23andMe is one of the best-known personal genome testing companies in the US, principally through its links to Google â€“ which has invested in it and the presence of Sergey Brin's wife Ann Wojicki on the board. Founded in 2007, it offers a kit for $99 which tests customers' DNA for genetic markers of illness and infirmity.It's similar in principle to the $3,000 test (by another genetics company), which confirmed that Angelina Jolie carried the BRCA1 mutation that markedly increased her chances of breast cancer. But 23andMe got into trouble with the FDA over what it can, and can't, tell users. The problem? Getting a false report that you carry a gene for cancer isn't a good thing, and 23andMe couldn't handle those risks.â€¢Â 23andMe suspends marketing after failing to meet FDA requirements3D PrintingIf there's one buzzword that has dominated the year, it may well be 3D printing. Things that have been 3D-printed this year include: a plastic gun, a metal gun, nine christmas presentsÂ (that ""look like I bought them in a panic at a jumble sale for 10p""), five Guardian writers, shoes, dresses, a robot arm, a 7"" single, and homes for hermit crabs.But in 2014 we'll see the other side of 3D printing, as issues of legality and usefulness come into play. Sure, youÂ can print all those things â€“ but how many do you actually want? And of those you think would be good, how many designs do you actually own the copyright for? ""Pirating"" an action figure or a dress might have sounded nonsensical five years ago, but it's the reality for the future.â€¢ One day, every home may have one4GThe superfast mobile broadband that promises to reinvent, or at least radically speed up, the internet on your phone, tablet or laptop, 4G finally became available in more than just big urban areas â€“ although it's still extremely pricey.

Now, when do we get 5G?â€¢ The 4G auction: what was it all for?",132.51,137.97,127.24163999999999,130.20002,25687.39,3388171.05,131.9
2013-09-03,"Boot up: HTC execs' arrest, Galaxy Mega reviewed, streaming kills pirates, and more",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/sep/03/htc-arrest-galaxy-mega-review,"At this point the Tech 128 gets a bit closer to home: internet porn, drugs, um ... Microsoft and tablets. Now read on, but be ready to hit the ""filter"" button at any time if you feel uncomfortable.Sex/filters/Cameron pornUnder pressure from campaigners, the UK prime minister declared that Something Must Be Done About Porn, where ""porn"" seemed to be hazily defined. It's an idea that has been pushed since at least 2011, when ISPs agreed to make them ""opt in"". (In Australia, it was going to be opt-out, and then it suddenly wasn't. Never let it be said that Australian politicians can't change their mind.)By July, Cameron had the bit between his teeth and announced that by the end of 2014 ISPs would present all internet users with an ""unavoidable choice"" on whether to use filters. He also pressured Google, Bing and Yahoo to block searches for illegal sites online - something with which Google finally complied in November.The trouble with filters, of course, is that they aren't perfect - particularly computer-based ones. Expect trouble over this.Silk RoadWhat's a bitcoin useful for? Often, it seemed, buying online drugs and illegal goods/services (including, if the affidavits around some of the arrests are to be believed, assassinations) at the marketplace hidden in the depths of the dark web. Accessible through the anonymous Tor network and trading in virtual bitcoin currency, Silk Road became a byword for all things stealthy and outside the ambit of the authorities. Until, that is, the FBI shut it down and replaced its front page with a sign saying ""THIS HIDDEN SITE HAS BEEN SEIZED"" â€“ raising the obvious question of how the site could really be hidden if you were looking at it, and quite what ""seized"" means in the context of a virtual object.Â The closing of Silk Road didn't make much difference: replacements, including one called Black Market Reloaded, sprang up almost overnight.Smart citiesDown these smart streets a man (or woman) must go ... to find a city that's smart. Getting sensors and intelligence embedded into the way that huge conurbations work is becoming imperative as we have more, and newer, super-cities. Seoul, South Korea, is in the lead here, in trying to capture real-time traffic information. More broadly, you can also look at the Chinese government's perhaps reluctant decision to make air quality data available as a step towards smarter cities in the Three Kingdoms â€“ try the China Air Quality IndexÂ app (iPhone orAndroid).Â Smart cities, however, need planning on a big scale to get them right: you don't want to decide after your roads are built that you need embedded sensors at every crossing. Equally, if you plan too early you can lock yourself into redundant technologies. The makers of smart cities are just grappling with the challenges ahead.Smartwatches & wearable techTracking our every twitch, step and move, fitness trackers and wearable sensors proliferated in 2013, but smartwatches generally failed to live up to the hype.Â Rumours of an Apple ""iWatch"" surfaced in February when Bruce Tognazzini, one of its earliest employees, blogged about the idea â€“ breaking a long silence. Tognazzini is well-connected, and so many hares began running. When Apple applied for an iWatch trademark in Japan, and supplier figures began surfacing, it seemed all but certain that there would be a new product after the iPhone and iPad.There wasn't â€“ so Samsung leapt in to fill the nonexistent gap with its Galaxy Gear, which was universally reviled by reviewers, leaving even its own executives talking of ""unripe fruit"".Sony too tried to capture peoples' attention with a smartwatch â€“ and mostly failed.In fact the best-selling smartwatch of the year came from Pebble, maker of the eponymous smartwatch funded through a Kickstarter project in 2012 that had 85,000 buyers. Thousands more have been sold since it went on sale in some US supermarkets. So ironically, a tiny company funded through crowdsourcing has had more success here than a giant mega-corporation. Isn't that the most encouraging technology story of the year?SnapchatTake a picture or video, decide how long, between 1 to 10 seconds, you want the recipient to view it for and then draw on top of it and/or add a caption. It's no-strings-attached picture messaging, as once viewed it is gone forever. The 23-year-old founder reportedly rejected a $3bn buyout offer from Facebook earlier this year.Â Is that all there is to Snapchat? Well, in effect, yes; but that's a lot right there. It captures the modern desire for some sort of transience, in a world where it seems like everything we do is recorded permanently whether by us or by something else. The question is, will transience be enough to give Snapchat staying power?Sonos Play OneWireless music is one of those things that seems like it has been promised forever. Sonos has been working away at it. While its earlier products had been expensive, in 2013 it released two products â€“ the PlayBar and Sonos One â€“ which suggested that good-quality sound with wireless remote control and internet connectivity at an affordable price weren't mutually exclusive. The Play One in particular, for Â£169/$199, will fill a good-sized room with solid sound.Spotify2013 has been a big year for Spotify â€“ but, at least to start with, not all the news was good. The company was forced to fight off competition from Google and Apple, who each launched their own streaming music services in the summer. Apple's iTunes Radio remains US-only for the time being, but Google Play Music All Access presented a more serious competitor â€“ if not a name which rolls off the tongue â€“ offering much the same service as Spotify's premium package for the same price.As the summer drew on, Spotify came under pressure from a second direction, with Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke criticising the company for underpaying artists. Yorke withdrew all of the music by his side project Atoms for Peace from the site in protest, tweeting: ""Make no mistake, new artists you discover on Spotify will not get paid. Meanwhile shareholders will shortly be rolling in it. Simples.""But by the autumn, the service was fighting back. It launched an all-out PR blitz to convince artists that it was actually paying a fair rate: ""Spotify has now paid out a total of more than $1 Billion USD in royalties to-date, $500 Million USD of which we paid in 2013 alone!"" And then, in December, it massively increased its free offering, letting users on mobile phones stream their playlists for free â€“ but only in ""shuffle"" mode. To top it off, it announced an exclusive deal with Led Zeppelin as the only streaming service carrying their music.Steve BallmerHaving been the chief executive that people (especially Microsoft investors) loved to hate, Steve Ballmer's abrupt announcement in August that he was going to step down within the next 12 months came as a shock. Ballmer had been in charge since January 2000, when he took over from Bill Gates. In an emotional farewell speechÂ at the last all-hands company meeting he would lead, Ballmer talked of the company as his ""fourth child"" and said: ""Children leave the home, but I guess in this case I'm leaving the home.""It transpired that he had been forced out by a combination of the board and activist investors weary of seeing the share price go nowhere while Google and Apple capitalised on the smartphone revolution to see their valuations rise â€“ Google's market capitalisation (the aggregate value of all its shares, nominally the market's guess of its total future profits) passed Microsoft's back in October 2012.The search is now on for a new chief executive, amid a Ballmer-driven reorganisation into a ""devices and services"" company which also removes the silos that led to divisional infighting. The question is, will the new leader come from inside or outside the company? And how will she or he make a mark on the company? Even though Office and Windows are huge moneyspinners, their base is threatened by the PC slowdown and the rise of tablets.Â Some have suggested that Stephen Elop, once leader of the Office division before he left to head Finnish handset maker Nokia, will be next in line. Certainly he has the experience in both software and hardware â€“ and Microsoft is buying Nokia's handset business. For many, he's the favourite.StickersYou have a messaging app. You need it to make money. You can't charge for the app because all the other messaging apps are free. What do you do?The answer: stickers. At least that's the answer used by Line and others. The advantage of stickers (which give users paid-for extra emoticons) is that you can keep coming up with new ones, and they tie users to you to some extent. BlackBerry's BBM is free. Should we count the hours until it starts offering stickers or their ilk?Â Tablet explosion!Budget tablets available for a little as Â£30 forced touchscreen computers into the mainstream, as the intersection of price and performance meant affordable tablets could replace traditional computers for most people. In a number of cases the cheap tablets were being used as replacements for TV sets or DVD players, but certainly for consuming digital content. And at the higher end, tablets could replace key functions of a ""PC"" â€“ and so take over its tasks, or do things it couldn't. The market for ""PCs"" - desktops, and laptops with fixed keyboards - has hit maturity, research companies concluded.Tesco's HudlA surprise budget tablet entry from supermarket Tesco, the Hudl proved that an affordable tablet could provide a decent experience and perform what most people needed most of the time. We'll have to wait for 2014 for sales figures, but the Hudl could establish itself in the UK alongside other smaller tablets.Thorsten HeinsWhen Thorsten Heins was appointed chief executive of RIM (as it was then known) in January 2012, replacing co-chief executives (and founder) Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, many people asked ""Thorsten Who?"" He had been the chief operating officer â€“ in effect, the man who got the trains to run on time.Trouble was, the trains at RIM (which rebranded itself BlackBerry in January 2013) were running very late. Its BB10 software for its new handsets arrived a year behind schedule in January, and on the Z10 â€“ a touchscreen smartphone that nobody wanted.Â However, Heins made a name for himself with some outspoken comments: in March he called the iPhone ""outdated""Â because, he said, their users couldn't multitask without changing app (apparently nobody had told him about Apple's Notification Centre). In that interview he acknowledged that ""we absolutely need BB10 to turn us around"". In April he said that in five years, ""I don't think there'll be a reason to have a tablet any more"" and that ""tablets themselves are not a good business model"". But he added that ""in five years, I see BlackBerry [being] the absolute leader in mobile computing â€“ that's what we're aiming for.""Â Oh well.Things got worse, and in November Heins was fired as a $4.7bn bid by Fairfax Holdings collapsed. The company brokered $1bn in cheap convertible debt. It has also stopped making the PlayBook tablet.Tim Cook & Jony IveApple's chief executive Tim Cook must be good at ignoring outside noise, because there was plenty of it in 2013: Apple hadn't invented anything for years (after all, the iPhone and iPad came out on a three-year cycle and now there was nothing), the iPhone didn't have 99% of the market, and what's more, he wasn't Steve Jobs.Â Even Carl Icahn saw the chance to prod a bit, buying some Apple stock and then â€“ as is his wont â€“ complaining that it should pay bigger dividends, especially from its cash pile.Â Cook had some uncomfortable moments, appearing before the US Congress to defend Apple's tax arrangementsÂ (including a jaw-dropping Irish company which didn't seem to be housed in Ireland). Apple put out an advert whose message (""this is what we do"") seemed more aimed at its own staff, to remind them what they did, than actual buyers.Then in June the new iOS 7 software design was unveiled: it was the first time Jony Ive, Apple's famous head of hardware design, had had his hands on the pixels too. Some loved it, others hated it, but it seemed to match the modern sensibility better than the now-ageing faux-leather of its six-year-old predecessor.Â Ive then had phones to match â€“ the 5S, unlockable with a fingerprint, and the cheaper (but not that much cheaper) 5C, where the ""C"" stands for colour. A biography of Ive by Leander Kahney revealed him as a key element and, sometimes, obstacle in Apple's development of new products, but one who is always thinking a few years ahead: his team had been working on designs for an MP3 player long before 2001 when the iPod was released.Now Cook and Ive face the tough task of satisfying people in 2014. No doubt they'll fail with many â€“ while pleasing many others.TinderSwipe narcissistically through pictures of the opposite sex in your local area who are also Tinder users. If you would consider ""getting to know"" a person you can swipe the other direction and if said person reciprocates then you two are deemed a match and you can start a chat together. Tinder gave the lie to the idea that location date-matching could only be done for same-sex couples using Grindr.Â Toca BuildersApps for children are a sort of hinterland: overlooked by many big-name publications, but focussed on furiously by app makers who realise they could make tons of money from them. Toca Boca is one of the most successful makers of childrens' apps, and has had more than 40m downloads in total since starting in March 2011. Its newest app is Toca Builders - which is like Minecraft without the gaming. (Yes, Minecraft doesn't have much gaming to start with. Let's move on.)BjÃ¶rn Jefferey, its chief executive, says:Â ""As an app developer, our intention is never to replace the parent, and I've never met a developer who tries to replace physical play with digital toys. The two aren't mutually exclusive, and they can even be combined."" To which we say: is that some sort of hint?Last instalment tomorrow",144.0,148.90893,142.2,144.0,15761.47,2289067.06,145.23
2013-08-28,Twerk and geek chic make the Oxford Dictionary - but which words would you add?,http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/aug/28/twerk-geek-chic-oxford-dictionary,"Now we come to the space where people played, interacted and disputed. Whether patents or selfies, there was controversy and absorption to be had everywhere.PewdiepieTwerking and rubbing yourself with a foam finger at award shows may whip up controversy and millions of YouTube views, but the real king of the video streaming platform is a Swedish 24-year-old who films himself playing video games.Miley Cyrus only managed to stay on top of the YouTube chart for a month before PewDiePie â€“ the alter ego of Felix Kjellberg â€“ regained the throne. With more than 15 million subscribers and more than 200m views most months, it looks likely to remain one of the most popular channels in 2014 â€“ its only constant challenger being the Turkish music industry channel MÃœ-YAP.Pierre OmidyarNot content with raking in billions of dollars from his online auction site, the founder of eBay decided to plough $250m into setting up a news organisation. Inspired, he suggested, by the revelations published by Glenn Greenwald from the Snowden disclosures, he recruited Greenwald. He's putting about the same amount in as Jeff Bezos paid for the Washington Post. Shall we come back in five years and see which one is more famous?PinterestCreate boards for different categories and pin pictures to the boards. A way to store online images that you love, or just to appreciate photography. And also a way for a company with no perceptible revenues to raise huge amounts of cash at startling valuationsÂ - wouldn't you pin a $38bn valuation to your wall?Prison ArchitectWant to run a jail? Of course you do! That's why you're gagging to play Prison Architect. It's pretty hard to disagree that you want to play something based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. We can't remember where in the Maslow's pyramid it is that building and managing a jail comes â€“ somewhere between Serco and G4S, we think â€“ but it's a radical idea that is sure to be popular in at least some boardrooms.â€¢Â Prison Architect â€“ the game that asks, what's it like to run a jail?PS4Sony introduced a games console. It's called the PlayStation 4 â€“ a name which surprised almost nobody, given that its previous consoles were the PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. It sold a million of them in a weekend, neatly refuting the idea that nobody was interested in games consoles any more, and 2.1m in its first two weeks â€“ including 250,000 in the UK.Andrew House, chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment, gave a helicopter view of progress in December, suggesting that any supply constraints will ease in spring and more games will become available.Â Quantified self movementThe ""quantified self"" â€“ AKA, in the words of writer and editor Paul Carr, ""vanity metrics"" â€“ began in California, naturally, so that beautiful people could measure just how much more beautiful the number of steps they had taken were making them. There are plenty of opportunities thoughÂ to do more, for example in real-time health tracking, game mechanics, and other fields. For some, the ability to publish what they've done is one of the biggest attractions of quantified self apps. Some, such as cycling, have become social so that people can race against others in different locations.Â QuipWith tablets becoming a Big Thing, what people have been looking for more and more is a word processor that is born on a tablet â€“ not a cut-down desktop idea, but something designed with touch control from the start. Quip is a collaborative word processor that looks more like a chat app so that you can see the thread of edits and changes by other people who are working on a document with you. After all, why should a document that will never be printed pretend to be a sheet of paper?Raspberry PiReigniting interest in coding and providing a platform for all sorts of projects, hacks and learning opportunities, the Raspberry Pi captured the imagination of children and adults alike, selling more than 2m computers by the end of November. A British success story.Â (Google) ReaderIn killing the popular (among its users) social RSS readerÂ from 1 July,Â Google reminded people that even if a service it offers is deeply loved by users, if it doesn't generate advertising revenue or in some other way fit into its aim of gathering more information aboutÂ users, then it's going to get a ride in the boot up into the mountains.Reader was an RSS reader that also let you share links with other people, so that you could get some idea of what was popular. Journalists in particular found it useful. But many groups found its social aspect, which had been almost accidental in its development, essential. Google instead tried to fold the sharing elements of Google Reader into Google+.Â Reader turned out to have a staff of roughly zero, but probably around 12m users â€“ almost all of whom migrated to Feedly. In March, Buzzfeed noted that ""Google Reader still drives far more traffic than Google+"". This may still be true even with Reader gone.For some small blogs, though, having Reader as an avenue through which they could be exposed to a wider audience was crucial. Without it, smaller voices have less chance of being heard.Â ResogunAll hail the PlayStation 4! If you like that sort of thing, anyway. Key launch titles included Resogun, which was free for subscribers to the PlayStation Plus online gaming service. We thought it looked like a bit of a ""flashy retro shooter"", but it quickly rose in everyone's estimations to become a game of the year: ""an old-fashioned arcade shooter that reinvents Armageddon as a frantic cascade of beautiful particle effects"", in the words of Nathan Ditum.RockstarThere's a long backstory to this one. In summer 2011, Google (paired with Intel) lost a four-day 20-round auction for the patent portfolio of bankrupt Canadian telecoms company Nortel. Its final bid was $4.4bn; the winners â€“ a consortium called ""Rockstar BidCo"", consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Sony, BlackBerry and Ericsson â€“ bid $4.5bn.Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt later said the price had been ""too high"", though Google then rushed to buy Motorola Mobility â€“ with its giant patent portfolio â€“ for $12.5bn in August.Apple and the others set up a company called Rockstar to administer the ownership of the patents. In principle, Rockstar is a ""non-practising entity"" (NPE) â€“ AKA a ""patent troll"" â€“ since it doesn't make anything, just asserts rights over its patents. Patent trolls are very unpopular in the US.Everything went quiet with Rockstar until at the end of October 2013, when it filed lawsuits in the Eastern District of Texas (which is notoriously patent-holder-friendly) against Google, Samsung, Huawei and HTC.Google is accused by Rockstar of infringing search technologies on a patent filed in 1997 â€“ before the search company was founded â€“ and on six other patents; it's seeking damages and royalties. The other lawsuits accuse the handset companies of infringing patents relating to mobile phones. In response, Google has filed a countersuit trying to move the case to California and asking a judge to dismiss the claims.Quite how this will end up is anyone's guess: the cases are bound to take years, but if Rockstar wins it could put a nasty dent in the profitability of smaller Android handset companies â€“ and if Google ends up paying a per-search tithe to an Apple-owned company, relations between the two will be more strained than ever.Â Ross UlbrichtUlbricht is a 29-year-old San Franscican, whose housemates knew him as a currency trader going by the name of ""Josh"". They knew he was a quiet loner, who cooked steak dinners for himself and spent independence day at home, but none of them expected the FBI to turn up one day and arrest Ulbricht, charging him with running Silk Road, the biggest online drugs marketplace the world has ever seen. Ulbricht says he is ""not excessively concerned"" about the future. Key to any case will be whether the FBI can tie him to ownership or operation of the site â€“ the location still remains a mystery, hidden as it was through the obfuscation of the Tor network. The FBI also seized a large and very valuable stash of Bitcoins which it said were being used by Silk Road.RovioThe Finnish company is famous enough to have featured obliquely in Armando Iannucci's satire on the US politics, Veep (when Selma Meyer visits Helsinki and is given a giant Angry Bird clock). From there it's only a short step to landing in Hollywood, which is where the company â€“ or at least some idea around it â€“ seems to be headed.Well, it worked for Moshi Monsters, which is entertaining popcorn-guzzling children as you read this, so why not something involving flightless catapulted birds demolishing loosely-built structures housing pigs? (There's been a mildly successful version, we recall, with a wolf instead of the birds, though we think the script might need some redrafting â€“ the ending wasn't so favourable.) If Aardman gets the gig, they could reuse some of the Plasticine from Chicken Run. Win-win.Satoshi NakamotoNobody knows who she or he is, nor even whether s/he is a single person or a group (though the latter seems unlikely). The pseudonymous Japanese name is a fake. But that is the given name of the inventor of Bitcoin, one of the Guardian's ten people of 2013.The New Yorker suggested it might be a Finnish researcher, Vili Lehdonvirta, at the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology. He laughed and denied it. The writer then suggested that Michael Clear, an Irish researcher, might be. He denied it too. Fast Company magazine pointed out that a patent filed in August 2008 by Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry seemed to have some similarities to Bitcoin's technologies; all three have denied being Nakamoto.It's widely believed that Nakamoto has a huge hoard of Bitcoins created back at the currency's dawn, which could now be cashed in for vast amounts. But again, there's no proof. All we have is Nakamoto's original 2008 paper â€“ and Bitcoin.Â Self-driving carsThere's been lots of hubbub about self-driving cars â€“ which seem simple in principle, but are actually very hard to do in practice (how do you avoid suicidal pedestrians, whose fault is it if there's an accident, how do you allow for changing roads if it works off a downloaded map, what if your internet access dies, what if the computer crashes, and so on). Yes, we've had self-driving aircraft for ages, but traffic at ground level is a lot less predictable than that at 30,000ft.Â Google is best-known for touting the idea, but it turns out (as a long New Yorker article pointed out) that lots of vehicle manufacturers are working on the same idea â€“ though they're thinking of assisting the driver, not replacing the driver, for all sorts of reasons. Meanwhile, Milton Keynes could be getting driverless ""pod cars"" as soon as 2017, according to business secretary Vince Cable. Under the Â£1.5m project, they'll share pathways with pedestrians and ""have sensors to avoid collisions"" to cover the one-mile gap from the shopping centre to the rail station. (Business hint: this may be a good time to set up an accident law firm in Milton Keynes. You know how clumsy pedestrians can be.)Selfies2013 is undoubtedly the year of the selfie; it found its way into the Oxford Dictionaries Online in August and was then named the Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year last month. (Note: ""Oxford Dictionaries Online"" is emphatically not the same thing as the Oxford English Dictionary, aka OED.)Some notable selfies this year? That time BeyoncÃ© agreed to pose in a selfie (while performing) â€“ oh, and that other time that three world leaders decided to snap a selfie at Nelson Mandelaâ€™s memorial.The question is: are selfies a pointer to our need to verify ourselves among the sea of incoming media showing the faces of others which threatens to inundate our own identity, or an indication of a growing narcissism and self-absorption to the exclusion of outward reality?

Similar thrills attended the mainstreaming of the phrase ""big data"", which made everyone wonder in embarrassment how they had got along with their pathetic wad of tiny data for so long.MetadataEdward Snowden's revelations about government spying revealed nothing if not a triumph of big data for the organisation once jokingly referred to as the No Such Agency. They also introduced the wider world to the sneakily deployedÂ term ""metadata"". As the word suggests (""It's allÂ gone a bit meta""), metadata is data about data:Â not the actual content of telephone calls, for example, but information about their length, the identities of the people involved, smartphone geolocation, and so forth. That's quite a lot to know already, much more than the kind of ghostly, low-fat info that defenders of state policies pretended ""metadata"" meant. Now that we know this, sadly, officials require a new word to describe data they hoover up while pretending it isn't all that important. Paradata? Pseudodata? I Can't Believe It's Not Data?SurveillanceNaturally, the term ""surveillance"" cropped up a lot post-Snowden. (So did the term ""Orwellian"", which ought to be henceforth abandoned in such contexts. It's a terrible insult to poor old George Orwell, who did not actually recommend that governments spy on everyone.) ""Surveillance"" was first brought into English in the early 1800s from the French surveiller, meaning to watch over. It seems odd now, but early uses of ""surveillance"" often implied a benign, caring observation rather than totalitarian intrusion. Conducting surveillance of your children in the past would have meant, say, employing a reliable governess, rather than hacking into their smartphones.SousveillanceOpposed to ""surveillance"" is the term ""sousveillance"", which was first coined by wearable computing pioneer Steve Mann a decade ago. AsÂ ""sous"" is French for ""under"", sousveillance is defined as either the recording of activity by the person doing it (via tiny cameras or other devices), or â€“ more politically â€“ surveillance of the powerful conducted by ordinary people: watching the watchers. Nonveillance, apparently, isÂ not an option.BitcoinThe point of bitcoin is to conduct one's economic affairs away from prying eyes. The electronic currency with no central bank was invented in 2009 by a mysterious individual who goes by the Japanese pseudonym ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", and who at current market prices for the virtual wonga is thought to be a dollar billionaire. The word ""bitcoin"" (it's coin made of bits, geddit?) spiked in media reporting this spring when its value crashed, and then again more recently when IT worker James Howells confessed that he had thrown away a hard drive containing Â£4m worth of bitcoins, which now languishes somewhere in a Newport landfill, guarded by a satisfied virtual Smaug.PrecariatThis nicely clever term for a newly insecure socioeconomic class was coined a few years ago by the sociologist Guy Standing, and came to prominence this April when everyone was taking the BBC's online class survey instead of actually working, thus making them more likely to join the precariat if they weren't already in it. The lexicographers of Oxford Dictionaries note that the word subsequently fell to its usual ""low level"" usage, but if the zany political economy of modern times is anything to go by, it will be coming in handy for a good while yet.Hard-workingSalvation from a plunge into the precariat, as well as all the other thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, will allegedly come, according to all politicians in 2013, from being ""hard-working"". In a short radio interview this year, Theresa May used the magical phrase ""hard-working families"" an impressive six times. No one, it seems, gives two hoots for only somewhat industrious clans, or workaholic singletons.ObamacareIn the US, ""hard-working families"" were going to benefit this year from ""Obamacare"", a shorthand term for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which one Republican senator recently called an ""Orwellian"" title for the legislation. (Poor George Orwell: still can't get a break.) The snappier name ""Obamacare"" was originally coined by a health industry lobbyist, and then first applied derisively by Mitt Romney in 2007. (In an elegant piece of rhetorical jiujitsu, the president later said he accepted the label, ""because I do care"".) Sadly, ""Obamacare"" was everywhere this autumn for the embarrasing reason that its website launch was an almighty technical ballsup. Not all Big Data is too big to fail.Binge-watchingTemporary escape from hard-working precariety could be sought this year by ""binge-watching"" all episodes of, for example, a TV series about people having sex with dragons. The term ""binge-watching"" had been around for years, but took off when Netflix released the  first season of House of Cards simultaneously, thus depriving competitive TV critics of a weekend's sleep. And the words that still, really, really didn't ",130.20501000000002,131.72442,128.02,128.76,11556.09,1498911.33,129.71
2013-08-26,Bitcoin lobbyists meet US authorities amid growing scrutiny of digital currency,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/26/bitcoin-lobbyists-us-authorities-scrutiny,"You may not have noticed it, but over the past year Google has bought eight robotics companies. Its most recent acquisition is an outfit called Boston Dynamics, which makes the nearest thing to a mechanical mule that you are ever likely to see. It's called Big Dog and it walks, runs, climbs and carries heavy loads. It's the size of a large dog or small mule â€“ about 3ft long, 2ft 6in tall, weighs 240lbs, has four legs that are articulated like an animal's, runs at 4mph, climbs slopes up to 35 degrees, walks across rubble, climbs muddy hiking trails, walks in snow and water, carries a 340lb load, can toss breeze blocks and can recover its balance when walking on ice after absorbing a hefty sideways kick.You don't believe me? Well, just head over to YouTube and search for ""Boston Dynamics"". There, you will find not only a fascinating video of Big Dog in action, but also confirmation that its maker has a menagerie of mechanical beasts, some of them humanoid in form, others resembling predatory animals. And you will not be surprised to learn that most have been developed on military contracts, including some issued by Darpa, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, the outfit that originally funded the development of the internet.Should we be concerned about this? Yes, but not in the way you might first think. The notion that Google is assembling a droid army that will one day give it a Star Wars capability seems implausible (even if we make allowances for the fact that its mobile software is called android). No; what makes the robotics acquisitions interesting is what they reveal about the scale of Google's ambitions. For this is a company whose like we have not seen before.Google is run by two youngish men, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who are, in a literal sense, visionaries. Google's shareholding structure gives them untrammelled power: while other companies have to fret about the opinion of Wall Street, quarterly results etc, the Google boys can do as they please. Where most public companies â€“ and all governments â€“ have nowadays little desire for risk, they appear to have an insatiable appetite for it. One reason for this is that Google's dominance of search and online advertising provides a continuous flow of unimaginable revenues. The company exercises a gravitational pull on the most talented intellects in their field â€“ software. Since software is pure thought-stuff, collective IQ is all that matters in this business. And Google has it in spades.What drives the Google founders is an acute understanding of the possibilities that long-term developments in information technology have deposited in mankind's lap. Computing power has been doubling every 18 months since 1956. Bandwidth has been tripling and electronic storage capacity has been quadrupling every year. Put those trends together and the only reasonable inference is that our assumptions about what networked machines can and cannot do need urgently to be updated.Most of us, however, have failed to do that and have, instead, clung wistfully to old certainties about the unique capabilities (and therefore superiority) of humans. Thus we assumed that the task of safely driving a car in crowded urban conditions would be, for the foreseeable future, a task that only we could do. Similarly, we imagined that real-time translation between two languages would remain the exclusive preserve of humans. And so on.What makes the Google boys so distinctive is not the fact that they did update their assumptions about what machines can and cannot do (because many people in the field were aware of what was becoming possible) but that they possessed the limitless resources needed to explore and harness those new possibilities. Hence the self-driving car, MOOCs, the Google books project, the free gigabit connectivity project, the X labs and so onâ€_And these are just for starters. A few months ago, an astute technology commentator, Jason Calcanis, set out what he saw as Google's to-do list. Here's what he came up with: free gigabit internet access for everyone for life; mastering Big Data, machine learning and quantum computing; dominating wearable â€“ and implantable â€“ computing; becoming a huge venture capitalist and developing new kinds of currency (a la Bitcoin); becoming the world's biggest media company; revolutionising healthcare and technologies for life extension; alternative energy technologies; and transforming transportation.If any other company had a to-do list such as this we would have its executives sectioned under the Mental Health Act. And it's possible, I suppose, that the Google founders are indeed nuts. But I wouldn't bet on it, which is why we ought to be concerned. Because if even a fraction of the company's ambitions eventually come to fruition, Google will become one of the most powerful corporations on Earth. And we know what Lord Acton would have said about that.",122.111,122.96996000000001,119.91611,120.07,10115.28,1226894.28,121.29

Maybe it's time to stop snickering. Demand for these odd-sized devices is growing so fast in Asia, Europe and Brazil that ""phablets"" worldwide in 2014 should outsell traditional smaller tablets, predicts Bob O'Donnell, the founder of Technalysis Research. ""I thought phablets were ridiculous at first,"" O'Donnell concedes. ""How could you hold one to your ear to make a call? But over time, they grow on you."" For 2014, he predicts that 175 million phablets will be sold worldwide, versus a more modest 165 million sales of smaller tablets (screens measuring 8 inches or less on the diagonal.)As only 16% of users' time on smartphones is spent talking, having a big screen is useful. But O'Donnell seems to be anticipating a larger Apple design ""in spring or autumn"". Stick to the latter.Toshiba ships DVD media with laptop without DVD drive >> Gadget WritingTim Anderson: One day you will be able to buy a Windows device and have a smooth and delightful experience getting started.To be fair, something like a Surface tablet can give offer a reasonable experience if you are lucky.Not so a Toshiba Portege Z930 ultrabook â€“ at least, not if you buy one with Windows 7 pre-installed, and want to run Windows 8, as a contact of mine has just done.Why would you not buy one with Windows 8 pre-installed instead? With hindsight, that is what I would recommend; but since it says on the box, ""This system is pre-installed with Windows 7 Pro software and also comes with a license and media for Windows 8 Pro software,"" he did not think it much mattered.The problem: The Z930 has no optical drive, but Windows 8 is supplied in the form of two recovery DVDs.Amazingly, things then get worse.An open letter to the chiefs of EMC and RSA >> F-Secure WeblogMikko Hypponen: On December 20th, Reuters broke a story alleging that your company accepted a random number generator from the National Security Agency, and set it as the default option in one of the your products, in exchange of $10m. Your company has issued a statement on the topic, but you have not denied this particular claim. Eventually, NSA's random number generator was found to be flawed on purpose, in effect creating a back door. You had kept on using the generator for years despite widespread speculation that NSA had backdoored it.As my reaction to this, I'm cancelling my talk at the RSA Conference USA 2014 in San Francisco in February 2014.Things are starting to happen.Why Huobi purportedly has higher volume than BTCChina and OKCoin >> Great Wall of NumbersTim Swanson: For those unfamiliar with Huobi, it is now the largest Bitcoin exchange in China doing roughly 40,000-80,000 in volume a day (versus 4,000 at OKCoin) â€“ though these numbers could be suspect (see the last section below).Â  Earlier today I spoke with my friend who is building an exchange in Shanghai who explained the volume discrepancy.The way the current exchanges in China are nearly all set up is that all of the trading is actually conducted using the CEO's personal bank account. Â That is to say, none of the exchanges (at first) utilized a corporate account. Â At some point this past year the big exchanges managed to switch to corporate accounts in some form or fashion. Â So on top of the 3rd party payment provider ban issues last week, the CEOs at the big exchanges (probably) expect some kind of crackdown on personal accounts so they are trying to go completely legitimate and avoid the risks associated with personal liability.Quite scary for the CEOs and those doing business through them.Inside knowledge likely in Target breach, experts say >> Network WorldPlot thickens: the scant details released by the retailer Thursday left some experts believing the criminals had to have some inside knowledge of the company's point-of-sale system in order to compromise it so effectively.Either people inside the organization were involved or, ""at the very least, (the thieves) had sophisticated knowledge and a clear understanding of the cardholder data flows, in order to pinpoint where to steal this very specific data and then exfiltrate it,"" Mark Bower, director of information protection solutions at Voltage Security, said.A world managed by apps is closed for those without a smartphone >> Tech Socio TechFJ van Wingerde sees a new sort of digital divide: The people who are economically disadvantaged enough that acquiring a new or replacing a broken smart handheld is just fricking hard, will find themselves burdened always having only secondary access to the world: always having to type 20 digit numbers though hostile phone menu trees to finish topping up, having to go to a specific location to find the right form and find it is out of stock this week and wasting a trip, carry little top-up cards and keys they may lose, not being able to remotely check on their homes or work, not reaping the benefits of a world going digital.Thieves hit Berlin Apple Shop after crashing in with stolen car >> BloombergThieves crashed a stolen car through an Apple shop window in Berlin early this morning, escaping with laptops, iPads and iPhones in two other vehicles, police said. It was the seventh break-in of its kind in the city this year.""These are not amateurs,"" Berlin police department spokesman Thomas Neuendorf said by telephone. ""We suspect that we're dealing with a gang.""A stolen Opel Corsa was used to smash the Apple store window and the thieves escaped in two Audis, Neuendorf said.

Tribune will spend $170m to buy out Gracenote in a deal that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014, and will combine it with Tribune Media Services (TMS).The sale comes five years after Sony acquired Gracenote in a deal worth $260mâ€_Sony has been making cuts in its media business, and has come under pressure from investor Daniel Loeb to spin off the entertainment unit. Getting rid of Gracenote, which provides technology not just to Sony, but to a number of its competitors in the consumer electronics world, therefore makes a bit of sense.The only way it makes sense is if it's losing money.Happy Christmas to everyone.

As such, it includes everything from password-protected forums and pages with no inward-bound links to more deliberately obfuscated content like that accessed through anonymising software such as Tor and I2P.In April the dark web hit headlines due to a security researcher who collated 500m connected devices, like servers, webcams, printers and routers, which were online but not properly secured. But it wasn't until October that the term hit the mainstream. In the same month David Cameron announced an intention to enlist GCHQ and the NSA to fight paedophiles operating on the dark web, and the dark web marketplace Silk Road was shut down.â€¢ How I bought drugs from the dark netDeath of Google ReaderÂ The demise of Google Reader, which lead journalists and hardcore news enthusiasts kicking and screaming into the night, showed that any free service could be disappeared once Google deemed it outside its core mission.â€¢ Google's attempt to push Google Reader users to Google+ is a mistakeDogeSo Wallpaper, So Doge Photograph: dilettantiquity/flickrDoge is the best meme of 2013.

Photograph: Jamie-James Medina/*NB Pictures for the ObserverArguably the greatest innovator of his generation, the serial entrepreneur Elon Musk is always one step ahead of the rest.As a 10 year old, Elon Musk developed a computer game which he sold for $500. When he was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, he paid for his tuition by organising house parties which included club-inspired art installations. And as an undergraduate, Musk even wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service remarkably similar to Googleâ€™s Book Service â€“ except that he wrote it ten years before Google announced it and more than three years before the company existed.2013 has proved to be a particularly memorable year for Elon Musk. The American business magnate, investor and PayPal founder advanced his plans for space exploration while his electric car company, Tesla Motors, became profitable and accelerated rollout of a network of supercharger stations in the US.But it was Musk's most outlandish technology proposition to date, the Hyperloop project proposed in August, that won him the most headlines. A $6bn (Â£4bn) proposal for a form of transportation linking LA and San Francisco, Hyperloop would provide subsonic air travel where pods travel in a partial vacuum within a 350 mile-long tube allowing commuters to travel between the American cities in just 30 minutes - faster than even a commercial aeroplane journey.With a group of Tesla and SpaceX engineers, Musk released an alpha-level design that went at least part of the way to working out how it would operate. The independent Ansys Corporation ran simulations using the design, and although there were modifications required, indicated that the challenges facing Hyperloop were capable of being overcome. Musk has expressed his intent to develop a prototype Hyperloop. Judging by his work with SpaceX and Tesla Motors, if anyone can make it work - Musk can.â€¢Â Elon Musk buys James Bond's Lotus Espirit submarine carEncryptionIn the wake of revelations about surveillance, encrypted email, messaging and document sharing was suddenly thrust into the mainstream, with Google, Twitter and Microsoft all increasing security of their consumer products and renewed determination among developers to keep private secure services, such as Silent Circle, private and impossible to crack.Â â€¢Â New Darkmail encryption aims to keep government spies outEphemeralityFromÂ SnapchatÂ to the music-streaming digital natives and even a whole generation renting rather than buying, 2013 has cemented the rise of ephemeral content and transient technology.Â â€¢Â Ten things you need to know about SnapchatFacebook IPO anniversaryFacebook's 2012 IPO was chaotic, with software buckling under demand, allegations that large investors were warned of problems and - as recently as this month - a judge declaring thatÂ the company should be suedÂ over risk warnings.

Even the CIA's own website states it loud and clear: ""Big Data is a Big Deal at the CIA.""â€¢ What exactly is a data scientist, and what do they do?Binge-watching TVThe rise of streaming websites has created a new legal way of watching TV: watching entire series in one go.

Netflix recently studied viewers that watched an entire series in one month and found that 50% of them finished an entire season within a week.â€¢ I just binged on ten hours of TVBitcoinAt the beginning of 2013, one bitcoin could be bought for $13. At its peak in November, that same bitcoin could have been sold for nearly a hundred times that, $1,242. That astonishing increase in value isn't the whole reason why the decentralised crypto-currency has made headlines across the world, but it doesn't hurt.A bitcoin has no physical counterpart. Instead, just like a Â£5-note is technically a ""promise to pay the bearer the sum of five pounds"", a bitcoin is a digitally signed public contract asserting that one user is giving another bitcoins. That lets the currency operate without any central authority certifying transactions, which gave it credibility in the techno-libertarian circles it arose from.Over the course of this year, bitcoin has been used to buy drugs on the Silk Road and evade currency controls in Cyprus and China. It has gone to space, and filled shipping containers in Hong Kong. One early adopter bought a house with bitcoin he'd paid $27 for, while another lost a hard-drive with over Â£4m worth of it on. And at the end of it all, it's on a downward streak that might just kill it any way.â€¢ Nine other alternative currenciesBlackberryThe phone once beloved of the email-addicted and workaholics â€“ including President Obama - couldn't stem the decline as it failed to compete with touchscreen rivals.

2013-08-16,"Bootup: Blackberry's patent goldmine, Dell's glimmer of hope and Google encrypts cloud data",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/aug/16/blackberry-ubuntu-google-dell-iphone,"Christmas is always a good time for reflection, as well as over-indulgence â€“ and all the more so for me this year, since I'm about to embark on maternity leave. So this seems like the ideal moment to name and shame a few horrors from the worlds of business and economics â€“ from the niggling to the downright scandalous â€“ which it would be cheering to think we could consign to the dustbin in 2014.1 Any last, lingering doubts that women can take on the top jobs: if the formidable Janet Yellen's confirmation at the Fed weren't enough, General Motors now has a woman (Mary Barra) at the wheel.2 The ""culture of worklessness"" and benefits as a ""lifestyle choice"". Handouts for the unemployed make up 2.57% of the Â£200bn benefits bill; tax credits and other top-ups for working people, 21%; pensions and benefits for the elderly, 42%. It's a complete nonsense to suggest, as George Osborne and David Cameron repeatedly have, that the burgeoning cost of the welfare state is a consequence of the failure of some in society to throw up their blinds in the morning and get on the bus to work.With unemployment now falling rapidly, and universal credit, when it is eventually rolled out, set to blur the lines between in-work and out-of-work support, there is some cause for hope that the Tories' ""skivers"" rhetoric may be (ahem) redundant. But with the chancellor conceding recently that he envisages cutting ""many billions"" from the welfare budget in the next parliament, don't bank on it.3Highway metaphors  George Osborne's repetition ad nauseum of the fact that we were on the ""road to recovery"", which was supplanted by the ""path to prosperity"" when the economy started to pick up, was bad enough. But when the Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, claimed that the 7% unemployment threshold was ""not our intended destination,"" but, ""a conveniently located layby"", at which we can ""study our economic map"", it became clear that the analogy was stretched beyond breaking point. (Though Dale deserves praise for his microwave analogy for the UK housing market, with its ""tendency to turn from lukewarm to scalding hot in a matter of a few economic seconds."")4Management gobbledegook More in hope than expectation, this one, but while we're on the subject of linguistic misdemeanours, we could do without any new additions to the list of corporate euphemisms for firing staff next year. To ""downsizing"" and ""rightsizing"", HSBC shamefully added ""demising"" in 2013. Let that be an end to it.5Chancellorial coiffure Whether inspired by the shift in the national economic climate, or in his own hairline, Osborne opted for a new, brushed-forward, Lego man-style do in 2013, prompting Michael Gove to quip that he had ""turned it around to stop the recession"". The less said the better from now on, thanks.6Banking shame Even before the ex-chairman of the Co-op was caught up in a cocaine-and-rent-boys scandal, it had been a deeply depressing year for anyone who hoped there were no more skeletons to emerge from the capacious closets of financial movers and shakers. With the fallout from Libor still reverberating, regulators have turned to examining (alleged) shady dealing in other markets, including gold and foreign exchange; while the fines for misconduct have come thick and fast, most recently for Lloyds, whose branch staff were put under intense pressure to flog useless products to unwitting customers. Is it too much to hope we can close the book on bad bankers in 2014? Probably.7Euro-austerity Greece's output has collapsed by more than a quarter since the start of the crisis in 2008, as its politicians have battled to implement the spending cuts insisted on by their friendly eurozone neighbours. With the crisis-racked country facing a funding gap, there will have to be negotiations over the fresh hell that Athens will be urged to inflict on its people. It's too much to hope that the cult of austerity will be abandoned; but it would be nice to think that with the German elections out of the way, Greece's creditors could afford to heed JosÃ© Manuel Barroso's call for ""discipline"" to be leavened with a touch of ""solidarity"".8Recycled infrastructure Osborne likes to pepper his statements with real-world projects his (very limited) largesse is making possible. Except that the same old potholed stretches of tarmac turn up over and over again. The upgrade of the humble â€“ but vital â€“ A14, from Rugby to Felixstowe, was first announced in the autumn statement of 2011; repeated in the summer's spending review; and re-announced, this time with Treasury funding finally attached, by Danny Alexander earlier this month. Perhaps we could institute a new rule that ministers can't claim credit for fixing anything until they can show us a pothole-free picture of the completed project.9 Bitcoin it's not a currency, it's a vanity project for underemployed, self-important tech nerds. The sooner the bubble bursts, the better.10 Scrooge employers whether, and how rapidly, real wages start to rise as the economy picks up will be a central question for policymakers in 2014. But alongside sagging wages, the downturn has seen an explosion in questionable employment practices, ushered in under the banner of the ""flexible labour market"" â€“ including the burgeoning use of zero-hours contracts, as revealed by Vince Cable's department last week.

2013-08-15,Concern mounts as Google confirms Android cryptographic vulnerability,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/15/google-android-bitcoin-securerandom-vulnerability,"Dear friends,So, as the Titanic of 2013 drifts slowly towards the iceberg of 2014, it is time to take a break from rearranging the deckchairs and whistling Nearer, My God, To Thee and send you the Mangans' annual round robin again.The bulk of the year was taken up with my sister and brother-in-law's relocation from Bristol to somewhere in the Devonshire countryside. I don't know where â€“ itÂ all looks the same to me. This was all done in pursuit of something she calls ""quality of life"". ""What's that?"" asked Mum, suspiciously, clearly about to file it under ""Modern Malarkey"", next to phrases such as ""self-esteem"", ""click here"" and ""food allergies"". ""It's when you try to construct a way of living that allows for something other than working, commuting and then falling exhausted into bed every night before rising six hours later to go back to work, weekends not excepted,"" explained Emily. ""Ah,"" said Mum, finding a spare slot and slamming the filing drawer shut.We packed her bad-quality life up into 3,000 boxes and unpacked it 80 miles to the right. Her mobile has no signal and BT hasn't sorted out the landline, so unless one entertains the preposterous notion that excommunication from the family would result in improvement of one's mental health and wellbeing, we have no way of knowing whether the undertaking has been a success.Mum has had aÂ busy year, re-laying the kitchen floor (it's exactly like the old floor, but cleaner), setting landmines for the slugs in the garden, and making a return visit with herÂ sister Judy to the Edinburgh Tattoo, mainly to apologise for last year. SheÂ continues to pour all the love and affection she so successfully withheld from her children into her grandson, who has fortunately developed calluses on his cheeks to inhibit Grandma's determined attempts to kiss his face off. Oh, and she had a troublesome tooth taken out and aÂ new oven put in.I've been waiting 30 years to use that line. Thanks, folks, I'mÂ hereÂ allÂ week.There is no doubting the highlight of the year, which was Dad's 70th birthday celebrations. They took place in a heavily fortified hotel in the north-west. We scraped the worst of the mould off him, stood him in a corner of the Garstang and Cabus Abattoir, Hostelry and Health Spa ballroom and, thanks to generous co-operation from the prisons department and various high-security hospitals, hundreds of relatives were able to come and ignore him while they enjoyed aÂ lavish meal of meat and potato pie with chips, mushy peas, extra chips washed down with Boddingtons bitter (mild for the ladies) and more pie for pudding. There was music, what passed for dancing, and a good time was had by all, especially Dad, who went to bed at half nine with aÂ book and a fervent prayer that he would soon be dead.As for me, well, I hardly know where to begin. I've found a red lipstick I like. M&S has started doing an all-milk-chocolate biscuit selection box. I almost understand bitcoins. I like the new pope. 2013's been great. My family and friends â€“Â despite some stomach-shrivelling scares â€“ are well, and happy. I hope all of you and yours are, too.Merry Christmas.",112.56206,113.321,108.78,109.99497,14794.82,1643457.67,111.08
2013-08-15,"Boot up: Bill Gates and the patent trolls, the eBay of hard drugs and Gruber on the iPhone  5C",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/aug/15/bill-gates-bitcoin-twitter-google,"This is the first in a series of posts by SustainAbility about business-model innovations that accelerate social and environmental impact. More than a decade ago, the Indian conglomerate ITC created a new model for sourcing agricultural commodities from rural villages. It brought internet terminals â€“ called e-Choupals â€“ into farming villages, which gave local farmers access to market information they hadn't had before. The innovation created business value for ITC by strengthening its supply chain, and provided social value by delivering benefits to farmers. But it did something else, too: it also disrupted the marketplace.  The terminals ended the information asymmetry that had long hindered rural farmers, who had little negotiating power at the government-mandated marketplace, called a mandi. The e-Choupal enabled access to market pricing information for crops, giving farmers the choice of when to sell and for how much. ITC has since placed 6,500 e-Choupals, serving more than 4 million families, in 40,000 villages. The model has strengthened ITC's agribusiness' supply chain and its relationships with farmer communities â€“ e-Choupal brings in 40% of agribusiness revenues â€“ and increased growth for the packaged foods side of the business. It also has offered farmers more choices, increasing the prosperity of base-of-the-pyramid farmers, and reformed the mandi system. E-Choupal is one of several examples of companies using a new business model â€“ the alternative marketplace â€“ to connect supply and demand in a way intended to boost social and environmental benefits. The alternative marketplace was one of the most popular types of business-model innovations among the 87 companies that SustainAbility reviewed this year. A full report, which will identify and analyze more than a dozen business model innovations for sustainability, is scheduled for release in January. Variations on a themeA number of businesses, large and small, are using alternative marketplaces. These marketplaces circumvent a traditional method of transaction â€“ or invent a new type of transaction â€“ to create a new marketplace and new value. Alternative marketplaces can reveal unused resources, flatten hierarchical systems and, in unique cases, create new channels for exchange. The model often, but not always, manifests through technology. Whereas ITC e-Choupal has focused more on social outcomes, other alternative marketplaces yield environmental efficiencies. OneMorePallet, a small and growing business based in Ohio, offers ""name your price"" shipping to small businesses that don't need their own trucks to ship their products. According to OneMorePallet, nearly 30% of each freight truck on the road runs empty. The company enables their clients to bid on empty truck space and for trucking companies to fill the empty spaces in their loads and increase profits. As a result, the shipping system becomes more efficient and the number of trucks on the road decreases. More often than not, the alternative marketplace is used by companies, but one unique nonprofit, Sirum, is also employing the model to reduce medical waste â€“ and help increase access to these drugs among the poor â€“ by matching unused drug supply to those in need.Every year, the US discards nearly $5b worth of prescription drugs. Much of this medicine could be reused, but most of it is incinerated or flushed away, sometimes causing damage to rivers and lakes. On the flip side, one in four Americans cannot afford the prescriptions they need. The Sirum team saw an opportunity to connect the dots. It wasn't easy; the founders had to activate a California law to allow the reuse of medicines. Then it built its own online marketplace â€“ it bills itself as the Match.com of unused medicine â€“ to connect drug donors, such as nursing homes and assisted living centers, with clinics and pharmacies that serve low-income patients. Sirum, now funded by grants, hopes to become financially solvent over the next several years by charging a membership fee to the recipient institutions that gain access to free, unused medicine through its site. And its experience so far provides a case study of how new marketplaces can arise and add value, in this case by extending the usability of prescription drugs. Building alternativesAs these three examples illustrate, the alternative marketplace idea applies to a wide variety of business â€“ and companies in many different sectors are employing new marketplaces to further their values. The concept also, of course, comes with some risks and challenges. Because alternative marketplaces circumvent traditional transaction channels or create new ones, they run the risk of raising the hackles of those who depend on current systems. There are also inherent challenges in creating an entirely new infrastructure for exchange, such as educating customers about how or why to use an alternative marketplace.    To be clear, we do not view alternative marketplaces as inherently more sustainable. For example, the online illegal drug marketplace Silk Road, whose customers used the alternative currency Bitcoin to circumvent the scrutiny of authorities, is an alternative marketplace being used for less than desirous effect. But marketplaces like those outlined here are increasingly being used to advance sustainability and provide more value to more stakeholders in a company's ecosystem. Perhaps these examples can provide other companies with inspiration to find new ways to make greater social and environmental impact.Lindsay Clinton is a senior manager at SustainAbility in New York and co-author of the forthcoming report on business model innovation for sustainability",112.56206,113.321,108.78,109.99497,14794.82,1643457.67,111.08
2013-08-13,Today's media stories from the papers,http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/13/media-briefing-tuesday-13-august,"1. Growth in mobile revenueseMarketer estimates that retail sales via smartphones and tablets have more than doubled to Â£8.2 bn in 2013, accounting for 18% of total UK ecommerce sales. Tablet commerce has seen particularly high growth, reaching Â£4.8 bn. In 2014 mcommerce is expected to increase by 53.3% in 2014, more than triple the 15% growth rate for retail ecommerce.UK mobile ad spend is expected to pass the Â£1bn mark in 2013, according to eMarketer, reaching Â£1.2bn (19% of total digital) - a 126.1% YoY growth. Mobile ad spend is expected to nearly double again in 2014 to almost Â£2.26 billion (32% of total digital).2. Mobile devices will not ONLY ""replace"" desktopsIt is no secret that we are deserting desktops for tablets and smartphones, and following tablet gifting bonanza this Christmas, mobile traffic is set to overtake desktop in early 2014. John Lewis is predicting that 2013 will see the UK's first 'mobile Christmas' with traffic from mobile phones and tablets overtaking that from desktops for the first time on Christmas Day. But not only mobile devices will surpass desktops in terms of traffic, they will excel them in enabling people do so much more on the internet: anytime, anywhere. And marketers need to be prepared for the always-on consumer.3. The Internet of ThingsThe Internet of Things and all of the devices associated with it are set to explode in 2014. Business Intelligence forecasts the number of IoT enabled objects to go from just under 1.85bn in 2013 to over 2.5bn in 2014 and 9bn in 2018 when they will account for half of all internet enabled devices. Imagine smart objects surrounding us in smart homes, offices and streets; everyday objects and appliances that can monitor their environment, report their status, receive instructions, and even take action based on the information they receive from our PCs, smartphones, and tablets. This will start an era when we no longer search for things, but they search for us and location-based marketing becomes ubiquitous. 4. Collaborative economyOpen, collaborative economy will create a real disruption for businesses.  The phenomenon of consumers co-creating content and products, sharing ideas and resources with each other is on ascend. For instance, Airbnb has topped 10 million guest stays since launch and now has 550,000 properties listed worldwide. In 2014 companies will need to understand their role in this powerful movement. 5. Branded contentEngaging with consumers through content creation will be another growing opportunity for brands in 2014. Successes of 2013 include Red Bull Media House and EE's GuardianWitness platform, and we will see more such initiatives going forward. Native advertising and close partnerships with established publishers will be cost-effective ways of content creation for brands.6. The power of mobile + social + videoThe combination of three biggest digital phenomena of 2013 will create another powerful trend in 2014, that of ""visual sharing"". Success of Twitter-owned Vine, a mobile service for sharing six-second looping videos, and Facebook's introduction of video on Instagram, mean that video will be the format of choice for people to share their moments and a go-to tactic for brands to engage with consumers. 7. Open marketingCollaborative economy, rise of branded content and growing consumer empowerment will mean that brands will need to involve influencers in their marketing, that is marketing WITH influencers, rather than merely marketing AT them. By doing so, not only brands will benefit from positive word of mouth, but the power of ideas that influential consumers can generate.8. Wearable technologyWristbands, like Nike+ Fuelband, smartwatches, medical devices and smartglasses will drive the market of wearables further to estimatedof 125m units in 2017, according to Strategy Analytics.Google Glass of course will steal attention in 2014, creating imaginative opportunities for marketers. Advertising will get even more targeted: location, content, context and mood-based ads, sponsored content cards, ""pay-per-gaze"" payment model, integration with print, outdoor, TV. And imagine how reach content partnerships are about to become.9. Happiness and well-beingWith money not being able to buy happiness, there has been an increased focus on personal well-being. ""Mood of the Nation"" research found that brands had a role to play in improving people's level of happiness through being ethical, empowering people to be more active and unexpected acts of kindness. In 2014 we will see more brands differentiating themselves from competition through influencing how people feel.10. Internet currencyIn 2014 we will find out whether peer-to-peer currency Bitcoin will get traction or turn out to be as over-hyped and short-lived as Second Life.",106.98998999999999,109.64,104.5,109.6,17808.47,1912320.25,107.38

There are perhaps 900m consumer PCs on earth, and maybe 800m corporate PCs. The consumer PCs are mostly shared and the corporate PCs locked down, and neither are really mobile - at best you can take them from table to table. Those 3bn smartphones will all be personal, and all mobile. So the internet goes from a shared device at home to a screen in everyone's pocket. And that's without considering several hundred million tablets, which blur all of these boundaries.Â This means that the internet gets several times bigger. One could talk about time, or engagement, or use, or value, and all of these metrics are problematic, but we go from 1.7bn shared and/or locked down devices on tables to close to 5bn devices most of which are personal and go anywhere. Mobile becomes the dominant part of the internet - we will stop talking about 'mobile internet' in much the same way that no-one talks about 'new media' anymore.Â Lots to consider there.What's the Titan supercomputer been up to? You won't believe It >> AllThingsDUsing first a smaller supercomputer named Anton, scientists at Oak Ridge, the University of Tennessee and the UT-ORNL Joint Institute for Computational Sciences simulated the behavior of 140,000 atoms from the biological signaling mechanisms in E. coli cellsâ€_Researcher Igor Zhulin likened it to a ""crazy light switch."" Previously it had been thought to be more static.Here's why the discovery is important, and it's not in any way trivial. Identifying this amino acid is the first step on a presumably long path that could in time lead to ways of controlling the signaling process in cells. Once that's understood, it could lead to drugs that could cripple the ability of disease-causing cells to make people sick.Emphasis in orginal article. Except it almost certainly won't lead to that, but it's a good way to get funding. ""Cure illness"" is always the claim made. ""Understand illness and ameliorate it"" is almost always the actual result.Research shows how MacBook Webcams can spy on their users without warningMarcus Thomas, former assistant director of the FBI's Operational Technology Division in Quantico, said in a recent story in The Washington Post that the FBI has been able to covertly activate a computer's camera â€” without triggering the light that lets users know it is recording â€” for several years.Now research from Johns Hopkins University provides the first public confirmation that it's possible to do just that, and demonstrates how. While the research focused on MacBook and iMac models released before 2008, the authors say similar techniques could work on more recent computers from a wide variety of vendors. In other words, if a laptop has a built-in camera, it's possible someone â€” whether the federal government or a malicious 19 year old â€” could access it to spy on the user at any time.There's a market for a new accessory there.. or just duct tape.Sent $35,104.11 USD to CoinBase.

For instance, way back in 1998 the CIH (aka Chernobyl) virus was discovered, capable of overwriting the BIOS chip of some computers to make them unbootable. You can read my memories of the Chenobyl virus over on the Naked Security site.If you were unlucky enough to have a computer which fell foul of the Chernobyl virus, your PC would have been useless. The only fix would have been to open it up and replace the chip.Q: So, the NSA's description of the BIOS plot is plausible?Woah.

Google Glass seems almost fashionable. But the evidence suggests that out in the real world, it simply isn't; six months into the experiment, even hardcore tech boosters who once wrote glowingly of Glass were seldom seen actually wearing the thing. (And these are some of the least fashion-conscious people on the planet.)The problem with Google Glass is not that it's bad industrial design. Google, like the rest of Silicon Valley, has learned a great deal about how to make an aesthetically pleasing product. But Glass is meant to be a highly visible addition to someone's body as they walk around in public. That demands more than just a gorgeous product; it demands a fashionable product. And the tricky task for wearables makers will be to understand the distinction.Things we use are tools.

Photograph: ONSHere's a closing summary.Britain's economic recovery continues as the country's unemployment rate slid to just 7.4%, its lowest level since April 2009, but real wages continued to shrink.In an unexpected move, almost 100,000 people left the ranks of the unemployed in the three months to October, and the claimant count fell by 36,500 in November. The full report is online here.TheÂ total number of people in work hit 30 million for the first time. The proportion of public sector workers in the economy hit a record low (since 1999).The news was hailed by the government as proof that its economic plan is working, but the opposition pointed out that the cost of living crisis continues, with more part-time workers keen to work full time than ever before. There was a clash over the stats in the Commons.Average wages rose by just 0.9% in the quarter, meaning pay packets actually shrank by 1.3% in real terms once inflation is factored in.Economists and business leaders broadly welcomed the news, but many pointed to the weak pay growth (see Duncan Weldon of the TUC).The Unite union warned thatÂ the recovery is simply passing many people by.And the boss of QinetiQ said more needs to be done to fight youth unemployment.And the drop in the unemployment count also means the Bank of England may have to consider raising interest rates sooner than expected.

It failed to spot that Britain was in recession in 2008, was taken unawares by the flat-lining of 2011 and 2012, and has now under-estimated the strength of the pick-up.Using unemployment as the basis for forward guidance on interest rates was always going to be problematical. The jobless rate does not move in the smooth, linear way assumed by the Bank: it tends to move up and down quickly depending on the state of the economy.

BTC's chief executive, Bobby Lee, said that YeePay gave notice on Wednesday morning Shanghai time that it would no longer provide services.Lee blamed government regulation for the decision. China's central bankÂ warned in early DecemberÂ that bitcoin was not legally protected and had no ""real meaning"", and barred financial institutions from using the currency.On Tuesday, the central bank extended that ban to payment companies like YeePay, and gave them until Chinese New Year, which begins on 31 January, to comply.At publication time, the value of one bitcoin on BTC China stands at Â¥2,630 (Â£266.02), down from a high of Â¥7,395 (Â£741.70) in late November.

Bank rate-setter Martin Weale suggested last week that if unemployment is falling rapidly at the point when the 7% threshold is breached, he would regard that as a reason to tighten policy.The details of the data suggested the jobs market has strengthened markedly over the past six months. The number of people employed across the economy has hit a fresh record high above 30 million, while there are more vacancies than at any time since the summer of 2008, before the UK slipped into recession.Â On the claimant count, which measures the number of people in receipt of out-of-work benefits, the number of people unemployed fell to 1.27 million, its lowest level since January 2009.Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said:â€œThis is an extremely strong set of labour market data, indicating that unemployment is currently coming down rapidly in reaction to the economyâ€™s markedly improved performance in recent months and much healthier business confidence.â€ùIn total, 485,000 new jobs have been created over the past year.Despite the improving conditions in the labour market, there is little evidence that the prolonged squeeze on wages is easing. The ONS said total pay rose at an annual rate of 0.9% in October, or 0.8% including bonuses. That compares with an inflation rate of 2.2% in the same month, suggesting that on average, living standards are continuing to fall.",126.3,133.98,125.35502,133.1,48649.99,6317090.66,129.85

Photograph: NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty ImagesGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world.Will we be wishing ourselves a merry Dectaper tonight?Â After weeks of anticipation, the Federal Reserve will decide whether the US economy is strong enough for it to start slowing its stimulus programme.The Fed isÂ currently pumping $85bn of new money into the US economy each month in an attempt to help growth (driving stock markets to current highs),Â and the decision on whether to slow (or 'taper') the scheme is going to be tight.It could also give new guidance on its thresholds for future interest rate rise, and tweak its economic forecasts.Â Dectaper makes the front page of the Financial Times today.The Federal Open Market Committee's decision comes at 7pm GMT, followed by a press conference, so traders are going to spend the day waiting nervously.As Chris Weston of IG puts it:Everything boils down to the FOMC meeting and Ben Bernankeâ€™s press conference 30 minutes later.Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics reckons the Fed may well dip its toe into tapering, cutting its programme by perhaps $10bn to $75bn/month. He said:We suspect the renewed strength of employment growth in the past few months will be just enough to persuade theÂ FedÂ to begin tapering its monthly asset purchases at the two-day FOMC meeting (19.00 GMT), which ends today. It will be a close call, however.Dear Fed: I believe I speak for all financial journalists when I say: just rip off the taper bandaid already and put us out of our miseryâ€” Leslie Shaffer (@LeslieShaffer1) December 18, 2013In the meantime, there's plenty at home and abroad to keep us occupied through the day.What's coming up?We get the latest UK unemployment data, at 9.30am. That will show whether Britain's labour market continues to recover, and whether there was any progress in raising wages to combat the cost of living crisis.The minutes of the Bank of England's last meeting are also published at 9.30am.....German investor confidence data (the IFO survey) is released this morning.European finance ministers will be meeting in Brussels today to debate the nitty-gritty of banking union, after eurozone ministers made a breakthrough on some key details last night (more to follow).#Eu #daybook: EU banks, German Confidence, U.K. Unemploymentâ€” Francine Lacqua (@flacqua) December 18, 2013I'll be tracking the main events through the dayÂ (although we might hand over to our US colleagues for the Fed decision, as there's 12 hours to wait....)",117.0,130.0,85.5,93.0,238226.32,26254439.22,110.21
2013-04-12,Eurozone crisis live: Cyprus tops agenda as finance ministers meet,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/12/eurozone-crisis-live-cameron-merkel-eurogroup,"The price of bitcoin has plummeted following an announcement from China's largest bitcoin exchange that it would no longer be accepting new yuan deposits.BTC China said that due to action by a third-party payment provider, YeePay, it could no longer accept deposits in the Chinese currency, although it would still be able to process withdrawals. BTC's chief executive, Bobby Lee, said that YeePay gave notice on Wednesday morning Shanghai time that it would no longer provide services.Lee blamed government regulation for the decision. China's central bank warned in early December that bitcoin was not legally protected and had no ""real meaning"", and barred financial institutions from using the currency.On Tuesday, the central bank extended that ban to payment companies like YeePay, and gave them until Chinese New Year, which begins on 31 January, to comply.At publication time, the value of one bitcoin on BTC China stands at Â¥2,630 (Â£266.02), down from a high of Â¥7,395 (Â£741.70) in late November. Bitcoin has dropped against other currencies in the same period, falling from Â£750 to Â£300 in the UK and from $1242 to $480 in the US.On 18 November, BTC China raised $5m in a funding round from institutional investors Lightspeed. Until then, it had been self-funded by its three co-founders, who opened the site in June 2011.Bitcoin remains legal to use in China, and the central bank is standing by an announcement that individuals are free to trade it at their own risk. But without third party payment providers, new purchases of the currency are virtually impossible.That raises doubts about the future of bitcoin. The large boom in value that the currency has seen this autumn is widely thought to be a result of Chinese users adopting it. As Chinese support has since waned, so too has the price.Bitcoin's supporters have consistently argued that the currency is impossible to fully ban, since it exists as a decentralised network of transactions. But if it can be rendered useless to merchants and customers, an actual ban may be unnecessary.â€¢ When thousands of bitcoins were stolen from an illegal marketplace, the users set out to track the culprit. But what started as the Maltese Falcon soon turned out to be more like Pink Panther.",124.9,140.0,54.25,117.0,556289.1,47600783.3,85.57

2013-04-12,"Boot up: Java Bitcoin malware, Apple and Motorola slapped, Ballmer's big bet and more",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/apr/12/technology-links-newsbucket,"Twenty years ago, there was nothing like the internet we have today, the global all-connecting network that has become an integral part of our lives. Over the last few decades, we have all witnessed how it has grown exponentially and come to change our everyday existence â€“ keeping most of us online all the time (with accompanying frustrations as well as benefits) and making communications and information exchange unprecedentedly seamless and fast.But I fear that we are at a turning point for the internet, and may even be going into reverse. The utopia of a borderless digital global village may be coming to an end. Fragmentation of the world wide web is already taking place â€“ along national borders.Edward Snowden's revelations on the scale of US online surveillance â€“ the Guardian's massive scoop of 2013 â€“ may be giving rise to a new era in history. The disclosures have already given rise to significant changes, including skyrocketing growth of the number of users striving for online privacy and choosing anonymity tools and browsers, and the astonishing swell in the value of bitcoins, the most widely used anonymous online peer-to-peer currency.But what may prove to be the ultimate game-changer is the fragmentation of the internet. A number of countries, among them Brazil and Germany, are considering carving out their own sectors of the internet, or may even have already started the process. If the trend spreads, which is likely, such fragmentation will bring about the creation of parallel networks as governments the world over try to isolate their critically important communications. Such networks with no physical connection to the internet are already widely used for military communications.The new networks will serve only governments and large enterprises with the aim of protecting national critical infrastructure from any possible foreign intrusion. This will mean they'll be more secure and reliable, but they'd come at a price, quite literally. Building such networks requires both huge investment over many years (funded by taxpayers) and a great deal of technical expertise (diverted from public services and innovative projects).This is probably good news if you're graduating with an IT engineering degree soon. Less so if you want to work abroad, because governments will prefer homegrown talent that can pass all the necessary security checks. Also, many countries â€“ even some high-tech giants like Germany, Japan and France â€“ could face a deficit of such workers.Internet fragmentation will bring about a paradoxical de-globalisation of the world, as communications within national borders among governmental bodies and large national companies become increasingly localised.Ordinary users will hardly perceive any change while these state-run parallel networks are being built, but there is another aspect of this global trend that will affect everyone directly. Some countries are already seriously considering making sure as much of their internet traffic as possible stays within their national borders.In some countries, for example Brazil, there's talk about forcing global giants such as Google and Facebook to locate their data centres locally to process local communications. If this trend gains worldwide momentum, it will be a disaster for global IT giants and pose a threat of full-blown Balkanisation of the internet. The process would probably foster the creation of local search engines, email systems, social networks and so on â€“ an intimidating prospect for publicly listed companies.As a result, the whole notion of netizens, or global online citizens, and of the internet being a global village could lose all practical meaning. What could emerge is a patchwork of online nation states with different rules and regulations and hindered communications.Sadly, I don't think the trend can be reversed. It feels as inevitable as the change of the seasons. But while one can't help complaining about bad weather in December, it's worth remembering that a bit of snow is not the end of the world.Internet fragmentation may mean better protection of national critical infrastructure; as a counterbalance, the politicians and diplomats of the world should be engaged in dialogue on how to keep the internet as close to how we know it today â€“ a global information highway.Eugene Kaspersky is chairman and CEO of Kaspersky LabGet more articles like this sent direct to your inbox by signing up for free membership to the Guardian Media Network â€“ this content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. ",124.9,140.0,54.25,117.0,556289.1,47600783.3,85.57

It is, in part, shady traffic that allows ad networks and exchanges to flourish. And these automated ad buying platforms â€” while they do a lot of good, no doubt about it â€” also put pressure on other publishers to sell ads more cheaply. When they do that, there's less money for content, and the content quality suffers.The ease of building bots, in other words, hurts what you read each and every day on the Internet. And it's all happening deep beneath the shiny web we know and (sometimes) love.Â A visual history of The Next Big Thing >> MediumPeter Sweeney: If the history of The Next Big Thing teaches us anything, it's that new media invariably dominates old media, regardless of how hard the incumbents try to keep new media down.Equally clear, the essence of The Next Big thing won't be technological. You begin by thinking it's trivial, but it isn't.Goldman Sachs has entered the iPhone ae >> Daily Intelligencerin 2010, JPMorgan Chase and UBS, two of Goldman's competitors, began testing pilot BYOD [Bring Your Own Device] programs. (BlackBerrys are a ""magnet for mockery and derision,"" said the New York Times last year, but they are also just bad phones.)Goldman Sachs will not be mocked, nor will it suffer the indignity of second-class smartphones. And so, according to several people close to the bank, Goldman began allowing employees to use iPhones as their official work phones this week.Goldman is among the slowest major institutions to let its employees use iPhones at work. Because of security concerns; staff have to download a specific app to access corporate email and other info. But it's another loss for BlackBerry.PayPal president David Marcus: Bitcoin is good, NFC is bad >> Internet & Media - CNET NewsMarcus is paying close attention to payment changes as part of his effort to re-energize an eBay service that grew sluggish and complacent after the early dot-com years. He's trying to foster innovation at the company and cater to developers, particularly those at start-ups.Although he has some concerns about bitcoin, he's unequivocal about near-field communications (NFC), the very short-range radio communication that can let people tap a credit card or mobile phone to a payment terminal.""It's technology for the sake of technology or for the sake of pushing the agenda of the companies supporting it, versus solving real people's problems,"" Marcus said of NFC.""Instead swiping or using a PIN pad, they're tapping. How is that really better? How is that changing your life? People don't want that,"" he saidâ€_""Why do you need to be at a place in a store to make a payment? [NFC is] too little too late.""China 4G licenses to impact smartphone display market >> DisplaySearch Blog[China Mobile's 3G system] TD-SCDMA's top speed was slower than the other two 3G standards, and more importantly, there was limited supply of TD-SCDMA devices. Due to this, China Mobile started to lose its customer base in the 3G market, especially for high ARPU (average revenue per user) subscribersâ€_On the contrary, both China Unicom and China Telecom had little interest in LTE TDD. They reaped the benefit of their 3G investments, especially by gaining high ARPU users. They preferred LTE FDD to LTE TDD, because they have multiple options in LTE-FDD network equipment and devices.As the 4G licenses the China government officially granted are for LTE TDD, China Mobile now has an advantage. In Q3'13, China Mobile released 207,000 LTE TDD base station orders through bidding and expected to release another 300,000 to 400,000 base station orders in 2014.China is the largest smartphone market in the world, with 30% of global smartphone shipments, according to the Smartphone Quarterly. While 3G is still the mainstream for commercial business, telecom carriers, especially China Mobile, will start offering 4G contracts and encourage consumers to upgrade to 4G LTE-TDD smartphones. Bigger screens, higher resolution, better display performance and lower power consumption will all be critical for 4G upgrades.Huge, huge numbers. It's hard enough to understand mobile, but figures like this emphasise how gigantic China is.Shazam predicts future pop stars by analyzing listener data >> CITEworldIn 2013, the service predicted Haim and French Montana would hit it big this year. Haim had a number of hits and recently played on ""Saturday Night Live."" Montana, a Moroccan-born rapper, had his first album debut at number four on the charts and worked extensively with established American rappers.In 2012, Shazam predicted A$AP Rocky and Lana Del Rey would be breakout artists, and both were resounding successes. Rocky reached number one on the U.S. charts, and Del Rey went to number one in the US and 10 other countries.How does Shazam do it? It combines the number of people that have used the app to identify a song to along with positive music critic reviews to see who are generating the most interest.Seems obvious enough, but first you have to get the app to be widely used - then you can do this.Hits, no errors: the secret of mobile success >> Tech.pinionsSteve Wildstrom on error messages on desktop and tablets: This is not to say that apps and even the OS in tablets never crash. But they do it quietly and gracefully, without generating an error message or requiring any action. When an iOS or Android app crashes, it usually just quietly shuts down and restarts itself, generally without loss of data and without affecting any other running apps. Even a system crash, rare in my experience, causes a reboot in which the tablet mostly or completely restores its pre-crash state.App updates are another place where tablets shine. Both Android and iOS automatically install app updates in the background. By contrast, as I was working on my Mac today, a Window popped up informing me that skyDrive needed to be updated. I gave permission for the update, which then proceeded to open at least six more windowsâ€“I lost countâ€“each of which required some action on my part. If the software needs updating, just go ahead an update it (the auto-update feature can be disabled on both Android and iOS, but I doubt that many users do.)I think the geekiest among us underestimate how important this well-mannered behaviour is to a lot of users.Google's European antitrust fight: still battling >> The EconomistThe core of the case against Google is the claim that it uses its dominance of search to skew internet users towards its own specialised services (for shopping, hotels, flights and so forth) and away from those of rivals. Part of the company's proposed answer to this has been to insert links to other shopping sites below Google's own.Two American professors retained by FairSearch Europeâ€”David Franklyn of the University of San Francisco and David Hyman of the University of Illinoisâ€”have tested how these links might work in practice. In a trial using 2,500 British subjects asked to look for specific items (eg, iPods or Nikon cameras) they found that Google Shopping scooped 36.7% of the clicks. The three rival links attracted just 5% between them. (Other clicks went to other parts of the page.) In the mobile version of Google's proposed solution, Google shopping got 43.3% against just 0.25% for the single link marked ""other sites"".You can follow Guardian Technology's linkbucket on PinboardTo suggest a link, either add it below or tag it with @gdntech on the free Delicious service.",166.48158999999998,188.7,110.20003,124.9,118645.43,18855846.81,158.93
2013-04-11,"Boot up: Bitcoin crashes, PCs dwindle, the truth about Summly and more",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/apr/11/technology-links-newsbucket,"Once a slur reserved for eggheads and an insult aimed at lovers of computer programming, geek has been deemed the word of the year by the Collins online dictionary.Less brazen than selfie â€“ which topped the Oxford Dictionaries poll last month â€“ geek was chosen as a reminder of how an insult can be transformed into a badge of honour, according to Collins.In September the dictionary changed the main definition of geek from someone preoccupied with computing to ""a person who is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about a specific subject'', adding geekery, geek chic and geekdom to the fold.Another word that has been reevaluated this year is marriage â€“ after changes to marriage laws mean that same-sex marriages will be carried out in England and Wales from 29 March. Previously defined as a relationship between man and wife, the online dictionary will now state that marriage is ""the state or relationship of living together in a legal partnership"" or ""the legal union or contract made by two people to live together"".Self-confessed word-geek Ian Brookes, Consultant Editor to Collins Dictionary and a lexicographer for the past 20 years, admitted that geek was not a word that had exploded into the language this year. ""That would probably belong to twerk,"" he said, adding: ""But we felt that that is not really a celebratory word.""Instead geek typified the type of word that could change their meaning and expand their longevity.""Just compare previous generations' use of words like cloud, tweet and tablet to ours,"" he said.""This change in meaning represents a positive change in perceptions about specialist expertise, and is a result of the influence of technology on people's lives in 2013.""The idea of future generations inheriting a more positive definition of the word 'geek' is something that Collins believes is worth celebrating.""Other fashionable lexemes have also muscled their way into the dictionary. Despite missing out on becoming the word of the year, the lexicographers found, much like the rest of the world, that it was impossible to avoid twerking this year and have defined it as ""moving the hips up and down as part of an erotically suggestive dance"". Other high-profile stories have resulted in the inclusion of new words such as Plebgate ""a public scandal in which cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell is alleged to have insulted police on duty in Downing Street by calling them 'plebs'"", Fracker ""a person or organization involved in the extraction of shale gas through hydraulic fracturing"" following protests after the governments decision to back fracking and Cybernat, ""a supporter of Scottish independence who is active on online forums"", after Sir Chris Hoy received abuse in online forums.Technology is well represented: the undeniably ugly Phablet is used to describe ""a handheld computer that is larger than a smartphone but smaller than a tablet computer"", such as the Samsung Galaxy Note, Harlem Shake makes the grade, while Bitcoin is described as ""a digital currency exchanged by users of the internet"". Thigh gap, Black Friday, payday lending and Olinguito â€“ an animal of the raccoon family, living in the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuado, apparently â€“ all feature in the 12 new words to be included.Since 2012 word fans around the world have submitted their favourites to Collins online, where lexicographers then choose ""candidates"" to add to the online dictionary, and put other words ""under review"" if more evidence of their use and importance need to be gathered. Others are flat out rejected, but, suggesting perhaps that meaning is more fluid online than on paper, not all of the words included in the online dictionary will make it into the Collins print dictionary.",166.48158999999998,188.7,110.20003,124.9,118645.43,18855846.81,158.93
2013-04-10,"Bitcoin is not a real currency, just some 21st-century cowrie shells",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/10/bitcoin-not-real-currency-cowrie,"We now go over live to the Old Bailey, where a statement is being read out by the defendant's solicitor â€_""I'm sorry if people have taken offence at anything I said. It was not my intention to upset anyone by calling them whiny, sanctimonious toddlers who clearly need to be affronted in order to feel alive. I regret that my words were taken out of context to infer something hurtful then used maliciously against me. I am deeply wounded that anyone could think so ill of me. My reputation for fair comment has been besmirched in a most cavalier fashion. I have to tell you, with a heavy heart, that my apology has been gravely impacted by this wilful misinterpretation. I believe I am now owed an apology by those who have exploited my predicament for their own cruel amusement.""Of course, it is ridiculous to imagine that someone could go from a grudging apologiser  to the aggrieved victim of an inferred hate campaign in the space of a single paragraph. Ridiculous, if you never see a newspaper and don't use social media.An aggressive apology is probably occurring less than 12 feet away if you're reading this in a bus queue. That woman in the bobble hat,  jabbing at her phone with fingerless gloves.  She's honing a 140-character putdown in the  form of a sarcastic apology for being ""too trusting and open"", adding the emoji for ""staring into middle distance, nursing a broken heart"".That young man in the ironic stubble is listening to Test Match Special. Geoffrey Boycott's on, doing his Yorkshire Apology. That's when you start a sentence with ""I'm sorry"", but you're not actually sorry at all. As in: ""I'm sorry, but my mum could've caught that in 'er pinny."" Or:  ""I'm sorry, but my mum could've 'it that wi'  a stick o' rhubarb."" Basically, the Yorkshire Apology is an expression of annoyance that you've had to apologise for someone else's appalling behaviour and that they've made you mention your late mother in whatever circumstances, wi' or wi'out rhubarb.That guy standing a little apart from everyone else, whispering into one of those tiny phones you attach to your ear, the ones that look like a child's kazoo. He's a customer complaints manager for a well-known retailer. Hissing at an intern, telling her he doesn't want her apology, he wants her to fix the problem. Apparently, a customer had complained and the intern had neglected to send out the standard email regretting that on this occasion the company had fallen below the high standards it sets itself, and apologising for any inconvenience caused. Actually, sorry, I don't think this bloke's in the bus queue at all. I've decided that as he's middle management, he must be a Tory and he's waiting for a cab. Remember Margaret Thatcher's famous words: ""Any man over the age of 26 using public transport is a socialist, which is why no decent person has been on a bus since they were in the fifth form â€_""Does anyone ever apologise these days for being bang out of order? It's now all about collateral damage limitation â€“ ""sorry if I caused offence"". I blame Twitter. Not just for this. For everything. But especially for this. Twitter is an international stock exchange for the trading of grievances, and apology is its bitcoin. And any currency can become massively devalued.Twitter's round-the-clock huff and chaff was a gift for online news in a recession. The ubiquitous fat, blue, chirpy harbinger of bathos took off just as the world economy was driven into a brick wall by the sort of people who wear communications kazoos on their ears. Newspapers had to slash their budgets yet expand their internet operations; had to spend less on journalism yet serve a jaded audience demanding drizzling news 24 hours a day. Twitter's echoing torture chamber is the perfect solution. Just get people trawling keywords, locate some potential umbrage and that's a story. Suddenly ""pressure is growing"" for X to apologise for Y, backed up by a single spluttering tweet from some busybollocks called @twirlyshirl who's got an animated loop of baby pandas on a slide as her avatar.Mandela died. The world paid tribute. Then the Twitter harvest of apology demands began. Comedian Simon Amstell ""suggested there was racial segregation between Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra and that Mandela would not approve"". Two hours of synthetic outrage later, and Amstell is obliged to ""tweet an apology"" for a weak joke with the word ""Mandela"" in it. The Czech prime minister had to apologise after he was recorded privately moaning about having to go to Mandela's funeral because he had something else on and it was a long way away. The news director of the BBC (NB ""a taxpayer-funded corporation"") had to defend its coverage after some viewers complained it had bumped a rolling story about floods AND interrupted an episode of Mrs Brown's Boys. His compliant, sort-of-apology â€“ ""I'm sorry if people felt as though we didn't inform them properly of what was happening with the weather"" â€“ was classic.It's getting worse. Paul Walker, a star of the  The Fast and the Furious films, died recently.  Two days later an answer on a game show was ""The Fast and the Furious"", and the producer  had to apologise for any distress caused. People have to apologise now for coincidence? For unforeseen context? God almighty, what a sorry world we live in.",230.04359,266.0,105.0,165.0,190141.86,35109363.41,184.65
2013-04-10,Bitcoin hits new high before losing $160 in value in one day,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/10/bitcoin-new-high-losing-160,"A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamThe 'Bitcoin Consumer Price Index' shows massive deflation >> BusinessweekAccording to the official US Bureau of Labor Statistics measure, prices measured in dollars are up 1.3% since January. That's mild inflation. Prices measured in Bitcoins are down 98.5% over the same period. This is a great development if you own a lot of Bitcoins. But it would be a disaster if it were the official currency of the United States--the coin of the realm, so to speak. Deflation is all about the buying power of a currency. It's not just prices of things people buy that fall in a generalized deflation. Wages and salaries also fall. So cheaper goods aren't really any cheaper in terms of your buying power. Two bad things happen in a deflation. First, people tend to postpone purchases as they wait for prices to get lower. That slows the economy to a crawl. Second, debts get more and more burdensome because they don't shrink the way everything else does. If you owed 1,000 Bitcoins before the deflation, you still owe 1,000 Bitcoins after it, only now your paycheck has shrunk by 98.5%. The only solution is to default. That's what happened on a massive scale in the Great Depression.Gmail blows up e-mail marketing by caching all images on Google servers >> Ars TechnicaRon Amadeo: This move will allow Google to automatically display images, killing the ""display all images"" button in Gmail. Google servers should also be faster than the usual third-party image host. Hosting all images sent to all Gmail users sounds like a huge bandwidth and storage undertaking, but if anyone can do it, it's Google. The new image handling will rollout to desktop users today, and it should hit mobile apps sometime in early 2014. There's also a bonus side effect for Google: e-mail marketing is advertising. Google exists because of advertising dollars, but they don't do e-mail marketing. They've just made a competitive form of advertising much less appealing and informative to advertisers. No doubt Google hopes this move pushes marketers to spend less on e-mail and more on Adsense.Those new Google Play Edition devices lack a photo gallery app, you have to use Google+ >> Android BeatStefan Constantinescu: Ever since Google launched its Facebook clone, Google+, it's slowly been integrating it into all their services. YouTube, Android, Google Drive - nothing can escape the Google+ reign of terror. The social network's latest victim is Android's photo gallery application. If you pick up either of the two new Google Play Edition devices that were announced yesterday, you'll notice that the only way to view the photos you've taken is to open the Google+ Photos application.

Sample size: one million users. All the courses were free.More labor abuse in Samsung phone factory >> China Labor WatchBased on an in-depth undercover investigation, China Labor Watch (CLW) has published a report on the labor conditions at a Samsung cell phone supplier, revealing labor rights violations that include $84,000 of monthly unpaid overtime wages, up to 148 hours of overtime per month, intense rates of work that have workers assembling one cell phone case every four seconds, regular verbal abuse by management, forcing workers to work barefoot, fines imposed on workers, and insufficient safety training and safety measures. In September 2013, CLW sent an investigator into Samkwang Science and Technology in Dongguan, China to work on the production line for two weeks. Producing cell phone covers, phone screens, and other parts for Samsung, the Samkwang factory employs over 5,000 workers. This investigation uncovered at least 23 ethical and legal violations, each of which is listed in the beginning of the investigative report linked below.Why do kids spend all day on social media? Because they're not allowed out of the house >> MIT Technology ReviewFascinating interview with Danah Boyd, a social researcher: You and your colleague Alice Marwick interviewed 166 teenagers for this book. But you've studied social media for a long time. What surprised you? It was shocking how heavily constrained their mobility was. I had known it had gotten worse since I was a teenager, but I didn't get it--the total lack of freedom to just go out and wander. Young people weren't even trying to sneak out [of the house at night]. They were trying to get online, because that's the place where they hung out with their friends. And I had assumed based on the narratives in the media that bullying was on the rise. I was shocked that data showed otherwise. And plenty more besides.Quinn Emanuel fights sanctions bid In Apple-Samsung war >> Law360Quin Emanuel is Samsung's law firm in California, and admits that unredacted details about the per-patent payment deals between Nokia and Apple prepared by an expert witness were wrongly accessible from its servers by a number of Samsung staff: Apple and Nokia have urged the judge to sanction Samsung $25,000 per day for not complying with court orders related to the leak. Both want Samsung's conduct mentioned in jury instructions in future trials with Apple, and Nokia demanded an injunction barring Samsung from suing it for 10 years, court documents show. But Quinn told Judge Grewal Monday that neither Apple nor Nokia has provided proof that the license information was leaked deliberately or that they had been harmed by the disclosure. Several of Samsung's experts had received the improperly redacted report, but hadn't opened it, Quinn argued.

The new strategy is expected to prompt other notebook brand vendors to follow suit and further delay Microsoft and Intel's schedules for popularizing touchscreen notebooks, the sources noted. The sources believe notebook vendors are unlikely to increase their ultrabook shipment proportions for 2014 due to weak demand, keeping the penetration rate of touchscreen notebooks at around 10%. Reasons: touchscreen notebooks are pricier, and consumers aren't interested.You can follow Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard.

2013-04-09,"Boot up: Facebook v Android, Wii U sales droop, Bitcoin mining malware and more",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/apr/09/technology-links-newsbucket,"George Osborne is a clever fellow, as he would be the first to admit under the threat of torture such as, for example, being forced to hear his deputy, Danny Alexander, play bagpipes. He was the first of Gordon Brown's many Tory shadow chancellors to rattle Labour's financial Ozymandias by teasing him as if he was Ozzy Osbourne.But one of the many burdens Osborne has inherited from the Brown era is the right of backbench MPs to elect select committee chairfolk, instead of feebly allowing the whips to do it. Left to themselves the whips would have saddled the public accounts committee (Pac) with streetwise Michael Meacher as chairman, instead of Britain's most ferocious pensioner, Marge ""Bring Up the Bodies"" Hodge.As for the Treasury select committee (TSC), the whips would surely have picked rugged Michael Fabricant for his technical grasp of the Divisia broad measure of money supply, which has shown a troubling increase since late 2011. Instead MPs elected Andrew Tyrie, a brainy Tory who knows a bitcoin from a bubble. He is also a member of the all-party Awkward Squad (Life President: Tam Dalyell), an elite band of Kryptonians left on Earth to expose the incompetent workings of government from the backbenches. Tragically, they are usually recalled to Krypton before their work is done.The chancellor was in an expansive mood when he appeared before the TSC on Thursday to discuss the presentational triumph of his credit-purchased autumn statement. His new hairstyle, the Michael Portillo (circa 1987) Pudding Basin Look, has bedded down and he waved his long, elegant fingers expressively as he batted off a series of questions from some smart MPs, plus Labour's John Mann.The trouble was that Krypton-to-Chichester's Tyrie has the chairman's prerogative to interrupt whenever he feels like it. He often does. Watching him was like watching an only slightly sadistic headmaster telling a slippery member of the pimply lower sixth that he'd marked down a sloppy essay from AAA to just above a junk bond. When the SNP's Stewart Hosie, one of several smart Scots on Osborne's case, complained of an ""extraordinarily evasive"" answer Tyrie told him with a worldly chuckle that chancellors have been peddling that one for a century. He's heard them all, has old Tyrie.Krypton's Wackford Squeers opened the interrogation with a mild question about ringfenced budgets like health and GCHQ. With an election looming, aren't all the parties tempted to bribe the voters â€“ ""isn't ringfencing good politics, but bad economics?"" he asked Osborne. It was a dagger in the chancellor's breast, virtually an accusation that he had been shoplifting at Harrods. Everyone knows George does politics 24/7. That Help to Buy scheme is blatant.""I don't accept your distinction,"" he replied before waffling on about embracing voter priorities (health) and ""investing"" in education. Pure Gordon Brown as usual: Brown was just the same, always ""investing"" in schemes to get him into No 10.John Mann came to No 11's rescue with a string of stupid questions. More cerebral colleagues followed. Osborne handled most well in a smug sort of way. But headmaster Tyrie kept yanking his chain with that thin, superior smile which Kryptonians mistake for warmth. Are you sure your Help to Buy scheme (good politics, but bad economics, anyone?) isn't ""adding vodka to the punch bowl just as the party gets going?"" he asked sweetly. Osborne said it wasn't. He would, wouldn't he ?And a breakdown of energy bills to help consumers, would that be a good idea? Tyrie later asked. Osborne Minor said he'd do it after cricket practice. Right at the end, Tyrie asked again about Help to Buy. Does the Bank of England have a veto or not? Osborne said it does and, there again, it doesn't. Not for nothing do Cameron groupies call the Chichester Kryptonian ""Andrew Tiresome"".",186.5,240.111,186.5,230.0,105724.64,22696282.53,214.67

2013-04-06,Why Bitcoin scares banks and governments,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/07/bitcoin-scares-banks-governments,"Bitcoin does not need to replace normal currency in order to have a future, according to an expert on digital currencies from professional services firm Ernst & Young.Speaking at an event in London, Roger Willis, who has been following bitcoin since its inception in 2009, described myths around the currency, one of which was its position as a replacement for ""fiat"" money.""Fiat currency is essentially currency the government decrees to be legal tender,"" Willis says. ""Bitcoin wasn't really developed to be a replacement for fiat currency. You see a lot of people talking about how bitcoin is going to take over, or how bitcoin doesn't have the properties that lend to it being used widely.""But it was really developed to be used in ecommerce and for micro transactions. It wasn't really to replace our sterling, our us dollars, and our euros.""With that in mind, the future risks for the currency take on a different shape. Currently, many critics are concerned with problems like price volatility and the deflationary nature of bitcoin. There will only ever be 21m bitcoins, and that has led some to fear that the currency will have a ""deflationary"" element in the future, leading to each unit getting comparatively more valuable over time.Deflation is often blamed for the ""lost decade"" in Japan, and an Ernst and Young spokeswoman stressed that the company adheres to the mainstream economic view that mild positive inflation is best for a national currency. But when it comes to using bitcoin as an ecommerce tool, deflation isn't necessarily problematic.Instead, Willis highlighted problems of speed and fraud control as the most pressing priorities for bitcoin. In order to prevent fraud, the bitcoin network ""confirms"" transactions every 10 minutes.""One of the weaknesses with bitcoin is you generally have to wait for five to six transaction confirmations before you're sure that the money hasn't been 'double spent', and that can take up to 40 or 50 minutes,"" Willis says.Some establishments have already decided that speed is worth the risk. For instance, the Pembury Tavern, a pub in Hackney, London, which takes bitcoin, accepts unconfirmed transactions as payment. But not every retailer can afford to do that â€“Â particularly if they are selling goods more expensive than beer.Overall, Ernst and Young ""have a balanced view"" on bitcoin, according to Colin Pickard, a financial services director at the company.""There are definite possible gains, in terms of lowered transaction costs, but there are some significant negatives, in terms of accountability and how to deal with anonymous users and how to regulate in the market.""A great number of companies that are operating today that don't think of themselves as financial institutions will have to be regulated and treated a lot more like financial institutions are today. But we aren't positive or negative on bitcoin itself.""â€¢ Apple's fear that Bitcoin might be branded illegal is keeping apps off the store.",142.05001000000001,143.9,139.54,142.63111999999998,18273.09,2597665.45,142.16

2013-04-04,Is the Bitcoin boom just a bubble?,http://www.theguardian.com/business/poll/2013/apr/04/bitcoin-boom-bubble,"Apple has forced a secure messaging app to remove the ability to send bitcoin payments or be booted off the the iOS App Store. The move reinforces belief that the company has an unstated policy against allowing bitcoin apps on the store, despite allowing alternative forms of ecommerce such as apps from PayPal and Square.The app, Gliph, lets users send secure texts back and forth, and also hooks up with online bitcoin services Coinbase and Blockchain.info to allow them to send money to friends. But that last feature was what raised Apple's ire.""We were asked by Apple to remove the ability to send Bitcoin from the iOS app,"" the company's co-founder, Rob Banagale, confirmed in a blog post. ""We fought to keep it in but it was not possibleâ€_ You can still create wallets, view balances and receive Bitcoin in the Gliph app for iOS.""Coinbase itself, one of the two online wallets which Gliph uses to enable the Bitcoin payments, was also forced off the App Store in November, and Blockchain.info's wallet app was pulled from the App store in 2012.Apple, which declined to comment on the issue, has been giving conflicting reasons to the developers of bitcoin apps. Blockchain were told that ""the facilitation of trading of virtual currency is not appropriate for the App Store,"" a rule which has no counterpart in the company's own App Store guidelines.Rob Sama, the creator of BitPak, another bitcoin app removed from the iOS store, says that he was told his app was removed because ""that Bitcoin thing is not legal in all jurisdictions for which BitPak is for sale"".""I inquired as to which jurisdictions Bitcoin was deemed to be illegal in, and he told me 'that is up to you to figure out'. I asked him which laws Bitcoin violated, and again, he replied that 'that is up to you to determine',"" Sama said after his app's demise.A year before that, Bitcoin Express, an app with similar functionality, was also removed. That time, the app's developer was given a specific rule which was apparently being violated: 22.1 of the company's guidelines, which reads ""Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer's obligation to understand and conform to all local laws.""The legal status of bitcoin remains hazy, but there is only one country where even making transactions in the currency has been clamped down on: Thailand. The Thai central bank, not knowing how to deal with bitcoin, issued a preliminary ruling in July 2013 which banned the currency until the bank could determine whether it could be used to speculate on the strength of the baht, which is illegal in the country.Removing bitcoin apps from the store entirely, or curtailing their ability to send bitcoins, goes much further than merely removing them from the Thai App Store, and suggests that Apple considers the use of the currency legally questionable even in nations which haven't pronounced on the issue.That may be due to bitcoin's long association with the black market â€“ notoriously, the currency is mandatory on drug marketplaces like Silk Road 2.0.. But any payment system can be used for crime; Apple has yet to clamp down on Silicon Valley darlings Square, despite reports that sex workers in California are charging customers using the e-commerce app.Banagale thinks that Apple's fear is simpler. ""If you believe Appleâ€™s repeated rejection criteria of section 22.1, you could take a view that the company believes the currency will ultimately be made illegal in the United States or other important markets. Rather than be forced to remove apps once theoretical regulation comes into play, Apple is simply not allowing them to exist in the first place.""â€¢ How the biggest bitcoin heist in history went from Maltese Falcon to Pink Panther",135.0,142.12,116.39063,132.12001,88124.78,11598387.76,131.61
2013-04-04,Today's media stories from the papers,http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/04/1,"Victims of the biggest theft in bitcoin history tried to put the much vaunted anonymity of the currency to the test as they attempted to recover their stolen money. But instead, they were left out of pocket and with egg on their faces.In early December, Sheep Marketplace, a site which used bitcoin and the anonymising browser Tor to enable online sales of illicit goods, shut down. The site's administrator reported that a dealer had found a bug in the system which had been exploited to steal 5,400 bitcoins.But users smelled a rat: they reckoned Sheep had probably been holding far more than that amount, and had returned none of the excess to users.Former customers of Sheep banded together, and discovered a bitcoin wallet holding 96,000 bitcoins which seemed to be linked to the thefts. At the exchange rate at the time, that was worth a little over $100m.Follow the moneyWhat happened next was only possible due to the unique features of bitcoin. The money started to be transferred between accounts â€“ and the users followed it.Bitcoin's approach to privacy differs markedly from the traditional financial system. The conventional privacy model works by strongly linking personal identities to transactions, and then sharing those transactions only with the two parties involved and trusted third parties â€“ normally payment providers such as Visa and Mastercard.Bitcoin's decentralised nature means that all transactions are necessarily public, because they have to be verified by the peer-to-peer system. To counter that lack of anonymity, the network is designed to separate transitions from identities: users can see that one ""wallet"" - denoted by a string of random letters and numbers â€“ has sent bitcoins to another wallet (another string of random letters and numbers), but can't easily find out who is behind those strings.For small transactions, that leaves anonymity largely intact, although there remains a risk that a particular pattern of transactions may render users identifiable; and if someone posts their address publicly, they are no longer anonymous. But when a block of 96,000 bitcoins moves through the network, the public nature of all transactions becomes more difficult to overcome.One member of the bitcoin subforum on Reddit was particularly tenacious in tracing the money. In a long series of posts on the subforum, ""sheeproadreloaded2"" detailed the many twists and turns the money took travelling through the systems.Small bitcoin transactions can be laundered using a ""tumbler"", which takes money from multiple sources, mixes it all together in one wallet, and spits it out the other side. Someone following the cash sees it get split and recombined over and over, until it's impossible to separate from the money being tumbled by other users.But that plan falls apart when trying to launder $100m of bitcoin. What the bitcoin thief found was that the sheer quantity of cash they were tying to hide overwhelmed every other transaction being tumbled at the same time: 96,000 bitcoins went in at one end, and 96,000 came out at the other. It seemed like their money had been successfully traced to one final address where it eventually came to rest.But then, the edifice came tumbling down. Another user on the subforum noticed their own bitcoins being transferred to the same address.And then the truth dawned: far from being a holding account for the biggest bitcoin theft in history, the wallet was actually part of the internal workings of BTC-E, an exchanges where users can trade bitcoins for conventional currency.It turned out that for three days, the community had been following not the increasingly desperate attempts of a thief to cover their tracks, but the internal workings of a currency exchange.Dead endsAt one point, at least, the internet detectives were on the right track. Sheep Marketplace really did shut down, and bitcoins were stolen. But rather than play a shell game to try and keep the money hidden, the thief appears to have done what any normal person would have: traded the digital currency for real money at the earliest opportunity.It's not the first time a bitcoin exchange has had its internal workings thrust into the spotlight. In November, a 190,000 bitcoin transfer (then worth $147m) made the press as the largest in history. Speculation abounded as to who had moved the money, with the Zuckerberg-bothering, bitcoin-investing Winklevoss twins and the currency's mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto both being named as possibilities.But in reality that transaction was probably just the result of Bitstamp, a popular exchange, shuffling its own funds: most of the money came from accounts known to be used by the exchange, and ended back in similar accounts later on.Nor is it the first time a crowd-sourced manhunt on Reddit has gone awry. The site has such problems with its user base attempting to track down wrongdoers that it enforces a rule against posting personal information â€“ known as doxxing â€“Â more thoroughly than practically any other rule it maintains.Even that didn't prevent users wrongly accusing Sunil Tripathi, a missing student from Brown University, of being the Boston Bomber in April this year. Tripathi was cleared when the names of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were released, but that wasn't in time to stop vigilates vandalising a memorial Facebook page and ""informing"" his family that he was a terrorist. Tripathi was found dead a week after the bombs went off.When it comes to Sheep Marketplace, the crowd is still working through the information. They think they've found the former moderator of the site, who has given an interview to the Czech Republic's biggest newspaper in an attempt to clear his name, and behind the scenes some users are trying to see if there are any other loose ends in the block chain.Sheeproadreloaded2 has left the scene, refusing to accept that they were wrong: ""You all stop [the thief] becoming the richest man in Europe in 20 years. I'm going home. I'm tired, I've got no milk in the fridge,and I need to go back to my day job of driving about in a van, solving mysteries. I think bitcoin is real, because I sell it. Most of you only buy it and change it into weed. It's the sort of money which not only buys political power - its enough to bend the fabric of space/time itself.""For the most part, though, things are back to normal. The second top post on the dying subforum is a review of some MDMA shipped by a vendor who moved to the Silk Road. ""It just misses the mark as the best MDMA I have ever usedâ€_ For the price, you can't beat it.""â€¢ Bank of America predict that Bitcoin could be worth $1,300, giving the currency its biggest boost yet.",135.0,142.12,116.39063,132.12001,88124.78,11598387.76,131.61
